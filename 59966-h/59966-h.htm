<h2 class="faux">FOREWARD</h2>

<p>In 1844 I wrote, and published in my series
of 'The Weekly Volume,' <span class="smc">William Caxton, a Biography</span>.
That little work sold as largely as
any of the collection. It will not be reprinted, as
I have cancelled the stereotype plates.</p>

<p>In the present work I have remodelled that
biography; rendering it a more compact narrative
of the state of knowledge before the invention of
printing, of the personal history of the man who
brought the invention to England, and of the nature
of his efforts to diffuse information amongst
his countrymen. This account forms the <span class="smc">First Part</span>
of this volume.</p>

<p>The <span class="smc">Second Part</span> embraces a very broad view
of the <span class="smc">Progress of the Press</span> to our own day,
especially in relation to the important subject of
<span class="smc">Cheap Popular Literature</span>.</p>

<p>In treating of the remarkable revolution of our
times in the prices of books, I cannot avoid incidentally
noticing some of my own labours in that
direction. I have done so as slightly as possible;
and, I trust, in the impartial spirit of an honest
chronicler.</p>

taught—Variations in English—Books before Printing—Libraries—Transcribers—Books
for the Great—Book Trade—No
Books for the People—Changes produced by Printing.</p>

<p class="nodent"><span class="smc">In</span> the first book printed in the English language,
the subject of which was the 'Histories of Troy,'
William Caxton, the translator of the work from
the French, in his prologue or preface, says, by
way of apology for his simpleness and imperfectness
in the French and English languages, "In
France was I never, and was born and learned
mine English in Kent, in the Weald, where I
doubt not is spoken as broad and rude English as
in any place of England." The Weald of Kent is
now a fertile district, rich in corn-land and pasture,
with farm-houses and villages spread over its surface,
intersected by good roads, and a railway running
through the heart of it, bringing the scattered
inhabitants closer and closer to each other. But
at the period when William Caxton was born, and
learnt his English in the Weald, it was a wild district
with a scanty population; its inhabitants had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">{2}</a></span>
little intercourse with the towns, the affairs of the
busy world went on without their knowledge and
assistance, they were more separated from the
great body of their countrymen than a settler in
Canada or Australia is at the present day. It is
easy to understand therefore why they should have
spoken a "broad and rude English" at the time of
Caxton's boyhood, during the reign of Henry V.
and the beginning of that of Henry VI. William
Lambarde, who wrote a hundred and fifty years
after this period, having published his 'Perambulation
of Kent' in 1570, mentions as a common
opinion touching this Weald of Kent, "that it was
a great while together in manner nothing else but
a desert and waste wilderness, not planted with
towns or peopled with men as the outsides of the
shire were, but stored and stuffed with herds of
deer and droves of hogs only;" and he goes on to
say that, "although the property of the Weald
was at the first belonging to certain known owners,
yet it was not then allotted into tenancies." The
Weald of Kent came to be taken, he says, "even
as men were contented to inhabit it, and by piecemeal
to rid it of the wood, and to break it up with
the plough." In some lonely farm, then, of this
wild district, are we, upon the best of evidence, his
own words, to fix the birth-place and the earliest
home of the first English printer.</p>

<p>The father of William Caxton was in all probability
a proprietor of land. At any rate, he desired
to bestow upon his son all the advantages of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">{3}</a></span>
education which that age could furnish. The
honest printer, many years after his school-days,
looks back upon that spring-time of his life with
feelings that make us honour the simple worth of
his character. In his 'Life of Charles the Great,'
printed in 1485, he says, "I have emprised [undertaken]
and concluded in myself to reduce
[translate] this said book into our English, as all
along and plainly ye may read, hear, and see, in
this book here following. Beseeching all them
that shall find fault in the same to correct and
amend it, and also to pardon me of the rude and
simple reducing. And though so be there no gay
terms, nor subtle nor new eloquence, yet I hope
that it shall be understood, and to that intent I
have specially reduced it after the simple cunning
that God hath lent to me, whereof I humbly and
with all my heart thank Him, and also am
bounden to pray for my father's and mother's
souls, that in my youth set me to school, by which,
by the sufferance of God, I get my living I hope
truly. And that I may so do and continue, I beseech
Him to grant me of His grace; and so to
labour and occupy myself virtuously, that I may
come out of debt and deadly sin, that after this
life I may come to His bliss in heaven." Caxton
seems to have had the rare happiness to have had
his father about him to a late period of his
life. According to a record in the accounts
of the churchwardens of the parish church of St.
Margaret's, Westminster, in which parish the first
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">{4}</a></span>
printer carried on his business, it appears that
one William Caxton, who is conjectured to have
been the father, was buried on the 18th of May,
1480.</p>

<p>Some time before the period of Caxton's boyhood,
a great change had taken place in the general
system of education in England. In the time
of Edward III., about half a century before the
period of which we speak, the children in the
grammar-schools were not taught English at all.
It was the policy of the first Norman kings, long
continued by their successors, to get rid of the old
English or Saxon language altogether; and to
make the people familiar with the Norman French,
the language of the conquerors. The new statutes
of the realm were written in French; so were the
decisions of the judges, and the commentaries on
the laws in general. Ralph Higden, in a sort of
chronicle which Caxton printed, says, "Children in
schools, against the usage and manner of all other
nations, be compelled for to leave their own language,
and for to construe their lessons and their
things in French; and so they have since Normans
came first into England. Also gentlemen be
taught for to speak French from the time that they
rocked in their cradle, and can speak and play
with a child's brooch [stick or other toy], and uplandish
men [countrymen] will liken themselves
to gentlemen, and delight with great business
for to speak French, to be told of." John de Trevisa,
the translator of Higden's 'Polychronicon,'
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">{5}</a></span>
writing some forty years later, "This manner
was much used before the Great Plague, and is
since some deal changed; for Sir John Cornewaile,
a master of grammar, changed the teaching
in grammar-schools, and construction in French;
and other schoolmasters use the same way now,
in the year of our Lord 1385, the ninth year
of King Richard II., and leave all French
in schools, and use all construction in English.
Wherein they have advantage one way:—that is,
that they learn the sooner their grammar; and in
another, disadvantage, for now they learn no
French, which is hurt for them that shall pass the
sea." It was this change of system, operating
upon his early instruction, which caused Caxton,
as a translator, to be so diffident of his own capacity
to render faithfully what was before him out
of French into English. Indeed from his earliest
youth to the close of his literary career, the English
language was constantly varying, through the
introduction of new words and phrases; and there
was a marked distinction between the courtly dialect
and that of the commonalty. We have seen
how he speaks of the broad and rude English of
his native Weald. But towards the close of his
life, in a book printed by him in 1490, he mentions
the difficulty he had in pleasing "some gentlemen,
which late blamed me, saying, that in my
translations I had over curious terms, which could
not be understood of common people, and desired
me to use old and homely terms in my translations.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">{6}</a></span>
And fain would I satisfy every man; and
so to do, took an old book and read therein; and
certainly the English was so rude and broad that I
could not well understand it. And also my Lord
Abbot of Westminster did show to me late certain
evidences written in old English, for to reduce it
into our English now used, and certainly it was
written in such wise that it was more like to Dutch
than English; I could not reduce nor bring it to
be understood. And certainly our language now
used varieth far from that which was used and
spoken when I was born: for we Englishmen be
born under the domination of the moon, which is
never stedfast, but ever wavering, waxing one season,
and waneth and decreaseth another season;
and that common English that is spoken in one
shire varieth from another. Insomuch that in my
days happened that certain merchants were in a
ship in Thames, for to have sailed over the sea into
Zealand, and for lack of wind they tarried at Foreland,
and went to land for to refresh them; and
one of them named Sheffelde, a mercer, came into
an house and asked for meat, and especially he
asked after <i>eggs</i>; and the good wife answered, that
she could speak no French; and the merchant was
angry, for he also could speak no French, but
would have had eggs, and she understood him not.
And then at last, another said that he would have
<i>eyren</i>; then the good wife said that she understood
him well. Lo, what should a man in these days
now write, <i>eggs</i> or <i>eyren</i>? certainly it is hard to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">{7}</a></span>
please every man, by cause of diversity and change
of language. For in these days, every man that is
in any reputation in his country will utter his
communication and matters in such manners and
terms that few men shall understand them. And
some honest and good clerks have been with me,
and desired me to write the most curious terms
that I could find. And thus between plain, rude,
and curious, I stand abashed; but in my judgment,
the common terms that be daily used be
lighter [easier] to be understood than the old and
ancient English." In these days, when the same
language with very slight variations is spoken from
one end of the land to the other, it is difficult to
imagine a state of things such as Caxton describes,
in which the "common English which is spoken
in one shire varieth from another," and there was
a marked distinction between plain terms and
curious terms. Easy and rapid communication,
and above all the circulation of books, newspapers,
and other periodical works, all free from provincial
expressions, have made the "over curious terms
which could not be understood of common people"
more familiar to them than the "old and homely
terms" which their forefathers used in their several
counties, according to the restricted meanings
which they retained in their local use. When
there were no books amongst the community in
general, there could be no universality of language.
Of this want of books we may properly exhibit
some details, chiefly to show one of the most remarkable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">{8}</a></span>
differences which the lapse of four centuries
has produced in our country.</p>

<p>We shall find it, we think, a more agreeable, as
well as more instructive course, to look at the
general subject of the supply of books in connexion
with the orders of people who were to use them,
rather than presenting a number of scattered facts,
to exhibit the relative prices and scarcity of books
in what are called the middle ages. We will first
take the clergy, the scholars of those days. The
mode in which books were multiplied by transcribers
in the monasteries is clearly described by
Richard de Bury, bishop of Durham, in his 'Philobiblon,'
a treatise on the love of books, written
by him in Latin in 1344:—"As it is necessary for
a state to provide military arms, and prepare plentiful
stores of provisions for soldiers who are about
to fight, so it is evidently worth the labour of the
church militant to fortify itself against the attacks
of pagans and heretics with a multitude of sound
books. But because everything that is serviceable
to mortals suffers the waste of mortality through
lapse of time, it is necessary for volumes corroded
by age to be restored by renovated successors, that
perpetuity, repugnant to the nature of the individual,
may be conceded to the species. Hence
it is that Ecclesiastes significantly says, in the
12th chapter, 'There is no end of making many
books.' For as the bodies of books suffer continual
detriment from a combined mixture of contraries
in their composition, so a remedy is found out by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">{9}</a></span>
the prudence of clerks, by which a holy book paying
the debt of nature may obtain an hereditary
substitute, and a seed may be raised up like to the
most holy deceased, and that saying of Ecclesiasticus,
chapter 30, be verified, 'The father is dead,
and as it were not dead, for he hath left behind
him a son like unto himself.'" The invention of
paper, about a century and a half before Richard
de Bury wrote, and its general employment instead
of vellum for manuscripts in ordinary use, was a
great step towards the multiplication of books.
Transcribers necessarily became more numerous;
but for a long period they wholly belonged to the
monastic orders, and the books were essentially for
the use of the clergy. Richard de Bury says, with
the most supreme contempt for all others, whatever
be their rank, "Laymen, to whom it matters not
whether they look at a book turned wrong side
upwards or spread before them in its natural order,
are altogether unworthy of any communion with
books." But even to the privileged classes he is
not sparing of his reproach as to the misuse of
books. He reprobates the unwashed hands, the
dirty nails, the greasy elbows leaning upon the
volume, the munching of fruit and cheese over the
open leaves, which were the marks of careless and
idle readers. With a solemn reverence for a book
at which we may smile, but with a smile of respect,
he says, "Let there be a mature decorum in opening
and closing of volumes, that they may neither
be unclasped with precipitous haste, nor thrown
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">{10}</a></span>
aside after inspection without being duly closed."
The good bishop bestowed certain portions of his
valuable library upon a company of scholars residing
in a Hall at Oxford; and one of his chapters
is entitled 'A provident arrangement by which
books may be lent to strangers,' meaning, by
strangers, students of Oxford not belonging to that
Hall. One of these arrangements is as follows:—"Five
of the scholars dwelling in the aforesaid
Hall are to be appointed by the master of the same
Hall, to whom the custody of the books is to be
deputed. Of which five, three, and in no case
fewer, shall be competent to lend any books for
inspection and use only; but for copying and
transcribing we will not allow any book to pass
without the walls of the house. Therefore, when
any scholar, whether secular or religious, whom
we have deemed qualified for the present favour,
shall demand the loan of a book, the keepers must
carefully consider whether they have a duplicate of
that book; and if so, they may lend it to him,
taking a security which in their opinion shall
exceed in value the book delivered." Anthony
Wood, who in the seventeenth century wrote the
lives of eminent Oxford men, speaks of this library
which was given to Durham College (now Trinity
College) as containing more books than all the
bishops of England had then in their custody. He
adds, "After they had been received they were for
many years kept in chests, under the custody of
several scholars deputed for that purpose." In the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">{11}</a></span>
time of Henry IV. a library was built in that
college, and then, says Wood, "the said books
were put into pews, or studies, and chained to
them." The statutes of St. Mary's College, Oxford,
in the reign of Henry VI., are quoted by Warton,
in his 'History of English Poetry,' as furnishing a
remarkable instance of the inconveniences and impediments
to study which must have been produced
by a scarcity of books: "Let no scholar occupy a
book in the library above one hour, or two hours
at most, so that others shall be hindered from the
use of the same." This certainly shows the scarcity
of books; but not such a scarcity as at an early
period of the Church, when one book was given
out by the librarian to each of a religious fraternity
at the beginning of Lent, to be read diligently
during the year, and to be returned, the following
Lent. The original practice of keeping the books
in chests would seem to indicate that they could
not be very frequently changed by the readers;
and the subsequent plan of chaining them to the
desks gives the notion that, like many other things
tempting by their rarity, they could not be safely
trusted in the hands of those who might rather
covet the possession than the use. It was a very
common thing to write in the first leaf of a book,
"Cursed be he who shall steal or tear out the
leaves, or in any way injure this book."</p>

    <p>Transcriber at Work.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>We have abundant evidence, whatever be the
scarcity of books as compared with the growth of
scholarship, that the ecclesiastics laboured most
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">{12}</a></span>
diligently to multiply books for their own establishments.
In every great abbey there was a room
called the Scriptorium, where boys and novices
were constantly employed in multiplying the service-books
of the choir, and the less valuable books
for the library; whilst the monks themselves laboured
in their cells upon bibles and missals. Equal pains
were taken in providing books for those who received
a liberal education in collegiate establishments.
Warton says, "At the foundation of Winchester
College, one or more transcribers were hired and
employed by the founder to make books for the
library. They transcribed and took their commons
within the college, as appears by computations of
expenses on their account now remaining." But
there are several indications that even kings and
nobles had not the advantages of scholars by profession;
and, possessing few books of their own,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">{13}</a></span>
had sometimes to borrow of their more favoured
subjects. We find it recorded that the Prior of
Christ Church, Canterbury, had lent to King
Henry V. the works of St. Gregory, and he complains
that after the king's death the book had
been detained by the Prior of Shene. The same
king had borrowed from the Lady Westmoreland
two books that had not been returned, and a
petition is still extant in which she begs his successors
in authority to let her have them back
again. Lewis XI. of France wishing to borrow a
book from the Faculty of Medicine at Paris, they
would not allow the king to have it till he had
deposited a quantity of valuable plate in pledge,
and given a joint bond with one of his nobles for
its due return. The books that were to be found
in the palaces of the great, a little while before the
invention of printing, were for the most part highly
illuminated manuscripts, and bound in the most
expensive style. In the wardrobe accounts of
King Edward IV. we find that Piers Bauduyn is
paid for "binding, gilding, and dressing" of two
books, twenty shillings each, and of four books,
sixteen shillings each. Now twenty shillings in
those days would have bought an ox. But the cost
of this binding and garnishing does not stop here;
for there were delivered to the binder six yards of
velvet, six yards of silk, laces, tassels, copper and gilt
clasps, and gilt nails. The price of velvet and silk
in those days was enormous. We may reasonably
conclude that these royal books were as much for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">{14}</a></span>
show as for use. One of the books thus garnished by
Edward IV.'s binder is called 'Le Bible Historiaux'
(The Historical Bible), and there are several copies
of the same book in manuscript in the British
Museum. In one of them the following paragraph
is written in French: "This book was taken from
the King of France at the battle of Poitiers; and
the good Count of Salisbury, William Mountague,
bought it for a hundred marks, and gave it to his
lady Elizabeth, the good Countess.... Which
book the said Countess assigned to her executors
to sell for forty livres." We learn from another
source that the great not only procured books by
purchase, but employed transcribers to make them
for their libraries. We find, from the manuscript
account of the expenses of Sir John Howard, afterwards
Duke of Norfolk, that in 1467 Thomas
Lympnor, that is, Thomas the Limner, of Bury,
was paid the sum of fifty shillings and twopence
for a book which he had transcribed and ornamented,
including the vellum and binding. The Limner's
bill is made up of a number of items,—for whole
vignettes, and half vignettes, and capital letters,
and flourishing, and plain writing. This curious
account is printed in the 'Paston Letters.' A
letter of Sir John Paston, who is writing to his
mother in 1474, shows how scarce money was in
those days for the purchase of luxuries like books.
He says, "As for the books that were Sir James's
(the Priest's), if it like you that I may have them,
I am not able to buy them, but somewhat would I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">{15}</a></span>
give, and the remainder, with a good devout heart,
by my troth, I will pray for his soul.... If
any of them are claimed hereafter, in faith I will
restore it." The custom of borrowing books and not
returning them was as old, we see, as the days of
the Red and White Roses. John Paston left an
inventory of his books, eleven in number, although
some of the eleven contained various little tracts
bound together. One of the items in this catalogue
is, "A Book of Troilus, which William B<span class="nogap">————</span>
hath had near ten years, and lent it to Dame Wingfeld,
and there I saw it."</p>

<p>But, even in the days before printing, there was
a small book-trade; and schemes were devised for
making books of some general use. In Paris, in the
middle of the 14th century, the booksellers were
commanded to keep books for hire; and, in a register
of the University of Paris, Chevillier found a list
of the books so circulated, and the price of reading
each. The hire of a Bible was ten sous. That the
ecclesiastics and lawyers constituted the great bulk
of readers, and that the addition of a book, even to
the private library of a student, was a rare occurrence,
is evident from the absolute necessity for manuscript
books being dear. If the number of readers had
increased—if there had been more candidates for
the learned professions—if the nobility had discovered
the shame of their ignorance—if learning
had made its way to the franklin's hall—manuscript
books could never have been cheap. But
from the hour when a first large expense of transferring
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">{16}</a></span>
the letters, syllables, words, and sentences
of a manuscript to moveable type was ascertained
to be the means of multiplying copies to the extent
of any demand, then the greater the demand the
greater the cheapness.</p>

<p>If the nobles, the higher gentry, and even the
lawyers and ecclesiastics, were indifferently provided
with books, we cannot expect that the yeomen had
any books whatever. The merchants and citizens
were probably somewhat better provided. The labourers,
who were scarcely yet fully established in
their freedom from bondage to one lord, were probably,
as a class, wholly unable to use books at all.
Shakspere, in all likelihood, did not much exaggerate
the feelings of ignorant men, who at the same
time were oppressed men, when he put these words
in the mouth of Jack Cade when addressing Lord
Say: "Thou hast most traitorously corrupted the
youth of the realm, in erecting a grammar-school:
and whereas, before, our forefathers had no other
books but the score and the tally, thou hast caused
printing to be used; and, contrary to the king, his
crown and dignity, thou hast built a paper-mill."
The poet has a little deranged the exact order of
events, as poets are justified in doing, who look at
history not with chronological accuracy, but with
a broad view of the connexion between events and
principles. The insurrection of Cade preceded the
introduction of printing and paper-mills into England.
Although during four centuries we have yet
to lament that the people have not had the full
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">{17}</a></span>
benefit which the art of printing is calculated to
bestow upon them, we may be sure that during its
progress the general amelioration of society has
been certain, though gradual. There can no longer
be any necessary exclusiveness in the possession of
books, and in the advantages which the knowledge
of books is calculated to bestow on all men. The
late Mr. Southey, a just and liberal thinker, but,
like many others of ardent feelings, sometimes mistaken
and oftener misrepresented, has truly pointed
out the difference between the state of society when
William Caxton was raised up to do his work
amongst us and the present state. The following
is an extract from his 'Colloquies on the Progress
and Prospects of Society:' "One of the first effects
of printing was to make proud men look upon
learning as disgraced, by being thus brought within
reach of the common people. Till that time learning,
such as it was, had been confined to courts and
convents, the low birth of the clergy being overlooked,
because they were privileged by their order.
But when laymen in humble life were enabled to
procure books, the pride of aristocracy took an
absurd course, insomuch that at one time it was
deemed derogatory for a nobleman if he could read
or write. Even scholars themselves complained
that the reputation of learning, and the respect due
to it, and its rewards, were lowered when it was
thrown open to all men; and it was seriously proposed
to prohibit the printing of any book that could
be afforded for sale below the price of three soldi.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">{18}</a></span>
This base and invidious feeling was perhaps never
so directly avowed in other countries as in Italy,
the land where literature was first restored; and
yet in this more liberal island ignorance was for
some generations considered to be a mark of distinction
by which a man of gentle birth chose, not
unfrequently, to make it apparent that he was no
more obliged to live by the toil of his brain, than
by the sweat of his brow. The same changes in society,
which rendered it no longer possible for this
class of men to pass their lives in idleness, have
completely put an end to this barbarous pride. It
is as obsolete as the fashion of long finger-nails,
which in some parts of the East are still the distinctive
mark of those who labour not with their
hands. All classes are now brought within the
reach of your current literature,—that literature
which, like a moral atmosphere, is, as it were, the
medium of intellectual life, and on the quality of
which, according as it may be salubrious or noxious,
the health of the public mind depends."</p>

<p class="nodent"><span class="smc">In</span> a book which Caxton printed in 1483, 'The
Booke callyd Cathon,' he says in his prologue or
preface, "Unto the noble, ancient, and renowned
city, the city of London in England, I, William
Caxton, citizen and conjury [sworn fellow] of the
same, and of the fraternity and fellowship of the
Mercery, owe of right my service and good will;
and of very duty am bounden naturally to assist,
aid, and counsel, as farforth as I can to my power,
as to my mother of whom I have received my nurture
and living; and shall pray for the good prosperity
and policy of the same during my life. For
as me seemeth it is of great need, by cause I have
known it in my young age much more wealthy,
prosperous, and richer than it is at this day; and
the cause is, that there is almost none that intendeth
to the common weal, but only every man
for his singular profit." It is the usual habit of
the aged to look back upon the days of their youth
as a period of higher prosperity and more exalted
virtue, public and private, than they witness in
their declining years. This is in most cases merely
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">{20}</a></span>
the mind's own colouring of the picture. But it
is very possible that London, in the first year of
Richard III., when Caxton wrote this preface, was
really less prosperous, and its citizens less devoted
to the public good, than half a century earlier, when
Caxton was a blithe apprentice within its walls.
The country had passed through the terrible convulsion
of the wars of the Roses; and it is the
nature of civil wars, especially, not only to waste
the substance and destroy the means of existence
of every man, but to render all men selfish, grasping
at temporary good, suspicious, faithless. The
master of Caxton was Robert Large, a member of
the Mercers' Company, who was one of the Sheriffs
in 1430, and Lord Mayor in 1439-40. The date
of Caxton's apprenticeship has not been ascertained;
but it is considered by several of his
biographers to have commenced about 1428. At
this period, the sixth of Henry VI., a law was on
the statute-book, and rigorously enforced, whose
object was to prevent the sons of labourers in husbandry,
and indeed of the poorer classes of the
yeomanry, from rising out of the condition in which
they were born, by participating in the higher gains
of trade and handicraft. A law of the seventh of
Henry IV., about two-and-twenty years before this
conjectural period of Caxton's apprenticeship, recites
that, according to ancient statutes, those who
labour at the plough or cart, or other service of
husbandry, till at the age of twelve years, should
continue to abide at such labour, and not to be put to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">{21}</a></span>
any mystery or handicraft;—notwithstanding which
statutes, says the law of Henry IV., country people
whose fathers and mothers have no land or rent are
put apprentices to divers crafts within the cities and
boroughs, so that there is great scarcity of labourers
and other servants of husbandry. The law then
declares, "That no man nor woman, of what estate
or condition they be, shall put their son or daughtor,
of whatsoever age he or she be, to serve as apprentice
to no craft or other labour within any city
or borough in the realm, except he have land or
rent to the value of twenty shillings by the year at
least, but they shall be put to other labours as their
estates doth require, upon pain of one year's imprisonment."
This iniquitous law was necessarily
as demoralizing and as injurious to the national
prosperity as the institution of castes in India.
Yet, by a most extraordinary blindness to cause
and consequence, the makers of the law provided
in the most direct way for its overthrow; for the
statute goes on to say, that, although the husbandry
labourer is always to be a labourer, "every man
or woman, of what estate or condition they be,
shall be free to set their son or daughter to take
learning at any manner school that pleaseth them
within the realm." The citizens of London, much
to their honour, procured a repeal of this act in
the eighth of Henry VI., about the period when
Caxton was apprenticed. The probability is, that
he would not have been affected by the exclusive
character of this law; for his master was a rich
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">{22}</a></span>
and distinguished mercer—a member of that association
which has always had pre-eminence amongst
the livery companies of London. The dignified
gravity, the prudence, and the prosperity of the
citizens of that day have been well described by
Chaucer:—</p>

<p>When we look at William Caxton as the apprentice
to a London mercer, his position does not
at first sight appear very favourable to that cultivation
of a literary taste, and that love of books,
which was originally the solace, and afterwards the
business, of his life. Yet a closer insight into the
mercantile arrangements of those days will show
us that he could not have been more favourably
placed for attaining some practical acquaintance
with books, in the way of his ordinary occupation.
When books were so costly and so inaccessible to
the great body of the people, there was necessarily
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">{23}</a></span>
no special trade of bookselling. There were indeed
stationers, who had books for sale, or more
probably executed orders for transcribing books.
Their occupation is thus described by Mr. Hallam,
in his 'Literature of Europe:'—"These dealers
were denominated stationarii, perhaps from the
open stalls at which they carried on their business,
though statio is a general word for a shop, in low
Latin. They appear by the old statutes of the
university of Paris, and by those of Bologna, to
have sold books upon commission; and are sometimes,
though not uniformly, distinguished from
the librarii; a word which, having originally been
confined to the copyists of books, was afterwards
applied to those who traded in them. They sold
parchment and other materials of writing, which,
with us, though, as far as I know, nowhere else,
have retained the name of stationery, and naturally
exercised the kindred occupations of binding and
decorating. They probably employed transcribers."
The mercer in those days was not a dealer in small
wares generally, as at an earlier period; nor was
his trade confined to silken goods—such an one as
Shakspere describes, "Master Threepile, the mercer,"
who had thrown a man into prison for "some
four suits of peach-coloured satin." The mercer
of the fifteenth century was essentially a merchant.
The mercers in the time of Edward III. were the
great wool-dealers of the country. They were the
merchants of the Staple, in the early days of our
woollen manufacture; and the merchant adventurers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">{24}</a></span>
of a later period were principally of their
body. In their traffic with other lands, and especially
with the Low Countries, they were the
agents by which valuable manuscripts found their
way into England; and in this respect they were
something like the great merchant princes of Italy,
whose ships not unfrequently contained a cargo of
Indian spices and of Greek manuscripts. John
Bagford, who wrote a slight Life of Caxton about
1714, which is in manuscript in the British Museum,
says, "Kings, queens, and noblemen had
their particular merchants, who, when they were
ready for their voyage into foreign parts, sent their
servants to know what they wanted, and among
the rest of their choice many times books were
demanded, and there to buy them in those parts
where they were going." Caxton tells us in the
'Book of Good Manners,' which he translated
from the French and printed in 1487, that the
original French work was delivered to him by a
"special friend, a mercer of London, named
William Praat." This commerce of books could
not have been very great; but it might have been
so far carried on by Robert Large, the wealthy
master of Caxton, that a lad of ability might thus
possess opportunities for improvement which were
denied to the great body of his fellow-apprentices.
At this particular period there appear to have
been but few opportunities even for the sons of
parents of some substance to obtain the rudiments
of knowledge. There is a petition presented to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">{25}</a></span>
parliament in the twenty-fifth year of Henry VI.,
1446, which exhorts the Commons "to consider
the great number of grammar-schools that sometime
were in divers parts of this realm, besides
those that were in London, and how few there are
in these days." The petitioners, who are four
clergymen of the city, go on to say that London is
the common concourse of this land, and that many
persons, for lack of schoolmasters in their own
country, resort there to be informed of grammar;
and then they proceed thus: "Wherefore it were
expedient that in London were a sufficient number
of schools and good informers in grammar; and
not, for the singular avail of two or three persons,
grievously to hurt the multitude of young people
of all this land. For where there is great number
of learners and few teachers, and all the learners
be compelled to go to the few teachers, and to
none others, the masters wax rich of money, and
the learners poorer in cunning, as experience
openly showeth, against all virtue and order of
weal public." These benevolent clergymen accomplished
the object of their petition, which was that
in each of their parishes they might "ordain,
create, establish, and set a person sufficiently
learned in grammar to hold and exercise a school
in the same science of grammar, and there to teach
to all that will learn." One of the schools thus
established exists to this day, in connexion with
the Mercers' Company, and is commonly known
as the Mercers' School. We are a little anticipating
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">{26}</a></span>
the period of our narrative, for this petition
belongs to Caxton's mature life; but we mention
it as an evidence of the extreme difficulty which
must have existed in those days for the children of
the middle classes to obtain the rudiments of knowledge.
It is evident that Caxton belonged to the
more fortunate portion, upon whom the blessings
of education fell like prizes in a lottery. The evil
has not been wholly corrected even during four
centuries; but it is devoutly to be hoped that the
time is not far distant when, to use the words of
the benevolent clergymen who knew the value of
knowledge at that comparatively dark period, there
shall be in every place a school, and a competent
person "there to teach to all that will learn."</p>

<p>Oldys, the writer of the Life of Caxton in the
'Biographia Britannica,' says, speaking of Robert
Large, the master of Caxton, "The same magistrate
held his mayoralty in that which had been the mansion-house
of Robert Fitzwalter, anciently called
the Jews' Synagogue, at the north corner of the
Old Jewry." This Old Jewry appears to have been
in earlier times an accustomed place of residence
for the mercers; for there are records still extant
of legal proceedings in the time of Henry III.
against four mercers of that place, for a violent
assault upon two Lombard merchants, whom they
regarded as rivals in trade. In the days of their
retail dealings they occupied a portion of Cheapside
which went by the name of the Mercery. In
the fourteenth century their shops were little better
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">{27}</a></span>
than sheds, and Cheapside, or more properly
Cheap, was a sort of market, where various trades
collected round the old Cross, which remained
there till the time of the Long Parliament. When
the mercers became large wholesale dealers in
woollen cloths and silk, the haberdashers took up
their standing in the same place. In the ballad of
'London Lickpenny,' written in the time of
Henry VI., the scene in the Cheap is thus described:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">

<div class="verse quote2">"Then to the Cheap I began me drawn,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Where much people I saw for to stand;</div>
<div class="verse">One offered me velvet, silk, and lawn,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Another he taketh me by the hand,</div>
<div class="verse">'Here is Paris thread, the finest in the land.'"</div>

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="nodent">The city apprentice in the days of Caxton was a
staid sober youth, who, although of gentle blood
(as the regulations for the admittance of freemen
required him to be), was meanly clothed, and subjected
to the performance of even household drudgery.
We learn from a tract called the 'City's
Advocate,' printed in 1628, that the ancient habit
of the apprentices was a flat round cap, hair close
cut, narrow falling bands, coarse side-coats (long
coats), close hose, close stockings, and other such
severe apparel. They walked before their masters
and mistresses at night, bearing a lantern, and
wearing a long club on their necks. But the mercer's
apprentice had some exceptions which set him
above his fellows: "Anciently it was the general
use and custom of all apprentices in London (mercers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">{28}</a></span>
only excepted, being commonly merchants and
a better rank as it seems) to carry water-tankards
to serve their masters' houses with water fetched
either from the Thames or the common conduits."
But, with all his restraints, the city apprentice was
ever prone to frolic, and too often to mischief. The
apprentices were a formidable body in the days
of the Tudors, sometimes defying the laws, and
raising tumults which have more than once ended
in the prison and the halter. Chaucer, writing
some few years before the term of Caxton's service,
describes the love of sight-seeing which was characteristic
of the London apprentice:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">

<div class="verse quote2">"When there any ridings were in Cheap,</div>
<div class="verse">Out of the shop thither would he leap;</div>
<div class="verse">And till that he had all the sight yseen,</div>
<div class="verse">And danced well, he would not come again."</div>

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="nodent">Cheap was the great highway of processions; and
London was the constant theatre of triumphs and
pageants, by which the wealthy citizens expressed
their devotion to their ruling authorities. In the
fifteenth century, when the very insecurity of the
tenure of the crown demanded a more ardent
display of public opinion, the London apprentice
had "ridings" enough to look upon, where the
pageantry was a real expression of power and
magnificence, and not a tawdry mockery, as that
which now disgraces the city of London once a
year. Froissart describes the riding of Henry IV.
to his coronation. The entry of his illustrious son
into London after the battle of Agincourt was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">{29}</a></span>
another of these remarkable ridings. This, which
was an occasion of real enthusiasm, took place
in Caxton's childhood. But in 1432, when he is
held to have been an apprentice, the boy king,
Henry VI., upon his return from being crowned
King of France, entered London with a magnificence
which chroniclers and poets have vied in recording.
Robert Fabyan, an alderman of London,
who wrote in the reign of Henry VII., describes
this ceremonial with such an admiration of the
pomp, as only one could be supposed to feel who
was born, as Chaucer says,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">

<div class="verse quote2">"To sitten in a guildhall on the dais."</div>

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="nodent">To look forward to such occasions of pomp was a
satisfaction to the people, who knew nothing of the
real workings of public affairs, and saw only the
outward indications of success or misfortune. The
reign of Henry VI. was an unhappy one for the
citizens of London. Violent contests for authority,
insurrections, battles for the crown, left their fearful
traces upon the course of the next thirty years.
But during Caxton's boyhood the evil days seemed
distant.</p>

<p>In the books of the Brewers' Company, which,
like all other records, were for the most part in
Norman French, there is a curious entry in the
reign of Henry V., which records a great change in
the habits of the people. The entry is in Latin, and
is thus translated: "Whereas our mother-tongue,
to wit, the English language, hath in modern days
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">{30}</a></span>
begun to be honourably enlarged and adorned, for
that our most excellent lord King Henry the Fifth
hath in his letters missive, and divers affairs touching
his own person, more willingly chosen to declare
the secrets of his will; and for the better
understanding of his people hath, with a diligent
mind, procured the common idiom (setting aside
others) to be commended by the exercise of writing;
and there are many of our craft of brewers
who have the knowledge of writing and reading in
the said English idiom, but in others, to wit, the
Latin and French, before these times used, they do
not in any wise understand; for which causes, with
many others, it being considered how that the
greater part of the lords and trusty commons have
begun to make their matters to be noted down in
our mother-tongue, so we also in our craft, following
in some manner their steps, have decreed in
future to commit to memory the needful things
which concern us, as appeareth in the following."</p>

<p>The assertion of the Brewers' Company, in the
reign of Henry V., that "the English language
hath in modern days begun to be honourably enlarged
and adorned," rested, we apprehend, upon
broader foundations than the "letters missive" of
the king in the common idiom. Great writers had
arisen in our native tongue, with whose productions
the nobler and wealthier classes at any rate were
familiar. The very greatest of these,—the greatest
name even now in our literature, with one exception,—must
have furnished employment to hundreds
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">{31}</a></span>
of transcribers. The poems of Geoffrey
Chaucer were familiar to all well-educated men,
however scanty was the supply of copies and dear
their cost. That Caxton himself was acquainted
in his youth with these great works we cannot have
a doubt. When it became his fortunate lot to
multiply editions of the Canterbury Tales, and to
render them accessible to a much larger class of
the people than in the days when he himself first
knew the solace and the delight of literature, he
applied himself to the task with all the earnestness
of an early love. In his preface to the second edition
of the Canterbury Tales he thus delivers himself,
with more than common enthusiasm: "Great
thanks, laud, and honour ought to be given unto
the clerks, poets, and historiographs that have
written many noble books of wisdom of the lives,
passions, and miracles of holy saints, of histories,
of noble and famous acts and faits [deeds], and of
the chronicles sith [since] the beginning of the
creation of the world unto this present time; by
which we are daily informed and have knowledge
of many things, of whom we should not have known
if they had not left to us their monuments written.
Amongst whom, and in especial before all other,
we ought to give a singular laud unto that noble
and great philosopher Geoffrey Chaucer, the which,
for his ornate writing in our tongue, may well have
the name of a laureat poet. For before that he,
by his labour, embellished, ornated, and made
fair our English, in this royaume [kingdom], was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">{32}</a></span>
had rude speech and incongrue [incongruous], as
yet it appeareth by old books, which at this day
ought not to have place nor be compared among
nor to his beauteous volumes and ornate writings,
of whom he made many books and treatises of many
a noble history, as well in metre as in rhyme and
prose; and them so craftily made, that he comprehended
his matters in short, quick, and high sentences;
eschewing prolixity, casting away the chaff
of superfluity, and shewing the picked grain of sentence,
uttered by crafty and sugared eloquence."
Again, in his edition of Chaucer's 'Book of Fame'
he says, "Which work, as me seemeth, is craftily
made, and worthy to be written and known: for
he toucheth in it right great wisdom and subtle
understanding; and so in all his works he excelleth
in mine opinion all other writers in our
English; for he writeth no void words, but all his
matter is full of high and quick sentence, to whom
ought to be given laud and praising for his noble
making and writing. For of him all other have
borrowed sith, and taken in all their well saying
and writing." There is another passage in the
second edition of the Canterbury Tales which we
quote here, not for the purpose of showing Caxton's
honourable character as a printer, for that belongs
to a subsequent period, but to point out that
manuscripts of Chaucer were in private hands,
varying indeed in their text, as books must have
varied that were produced by different transcribers,
but still keeping up the fame of the poet, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">{33}</a></span>
highly valued by their possessors: "Of which
book so incorrect was one brought to me six year
passed, which I supposed had been very true and
correct, and according to the same I did imprint
a certain number of them, which anon were sold
to many and divers gentlemen: of whom one gentleman
came to me, and said that this book was
not according in many places unto the book that
Geoffrey Chaucer had made. To whom I answered,
that I had made it according to my copy,
and by me was nothing added nor diminished.
Then he said he knew a book which his father had
and much loved, that was very true, and according
unto his own first book by him made; and said
more, if I would imprint it again, he would get me
the same book for a copy. How be it, he wist well
his father would not gladly part from it; to whom
I said, in case that he could get me such a book
true and correct, that I would once endeavour me
to imprint it again, for to satisfy the author:
whereas before by ignorance I erred in hurting and
defaming his book in divers places, in setting in
some things that he never said nor made, and
leaving out many things that he made which are
requisite to be set in. And thus we fell at accord;
and he full gently got me of his father the said
book, and delivered it to me, by which I have corrected
my book."</p>

<p>There was another poet of considerable popularity
who was contemporary with Chaucer. With
the works of Gower, Caxton must have been familiar.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">{34}</a></span>
His principal poem, 'Confessio Amantis,'
was printed by Caxton in 1483, and is said to have
been the most extensively circulated of all the
books that came from his press. The poem is full
of stories that were probably common to all Europe,
running on through thousands of lines with wonderful
fluency, but little force. He was called the
"moral Gower" by Chaucer. The play of Pericles,
ascribed to Shakspere, is founded upon one of
these stories. Gower himself shows us what was
the general course of reading in those days:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">

<div class="verse quote2">"Full oft time it falleth so,</div>
<div class="verse">Mine ear with a good pittance</div>
<div class="verse">Is fed of reading of romance,</div>
<div class="verse">Of Idoyne, and of Amadas,</div>
<div class="verse">That whilom<span
     class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_6" id="Ref_6" href="#Foot_6">[6]</a></span> weren<span

     class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_9" id="Ref_9" href="#Foot_9">[9]</a></span></div>

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="nodent">The romances of chivalry, the stories of "fierce
wars and faithful loves," were especially the delight
of the great and powerful. When the noble was
in camp, he solaced his hours of leisure with the
marvellous histories of King Arthur or Launcelot
of the Lake; and when at home, he listened to or
read the same stories in the intervals of the chace
or the feast. Froissart tells in his own simple and
graphic manner how he presented a book to King
Richard the Second, and how the king delighted
in the subject of the book: "Then the king desired
to see my book that I had brought for him; so he
saw it in his chamber, for I had laid it there ready
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">{35}</a></span>
on his bed. When the king opened it, it pleased
him well, for it was fair illumined and written, and
covered with crimson velvet, with ten buttons of
silver and gilt, and roses of gold in the midst, with
two great clasps, gilt, richly wrought. Then the
king demanded me whereof it treated, and I
showed him how it treated matters of love, whereof
the king was glad, and looked in it, and read it in
many places, for he could speak and read French
very well." Froissart was a Frenchman and wrote
in French; but even Englishmen wrote in French
at that period, and some of Gower's early poems
are in French. According to his own account, the
long poem of the 'Confessio Amantis,' which was
written in English, was executed at the command
of the same King Richard:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">

<div class="verse quote2">"He hath this charge upon me laid,</div>
<div class="verse">And bad me do my business,</div>
<div class="verse">That to his high worthiness</div>
<div class="verse">Some new thing I should book,</div>
<div class="verse">That he himself it might look,</div>
<div class="verse">After the form of my writing."</div>

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Chaucer and Gower lived some time before the
period of Caxton's youth in London, But there
was a poet very popular in his day, whom he can
scarcely have avoided having seen playing a conspicuous
part in the high city festivals. This was
John Lydgate, monk of Bury, who thus describes
himself—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">

<div class="verse quote2">"I am a monk by my profession,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Of Bury, called John Lydgate by my name,</div>
<div class="verse">And wear a habit of perfection,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Although my life agree not with the same."</div>

</div>
</div>
</div>

<div class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">{36}</a></div>

<div class="image-center">
  <img src="images/lydgate.jpg" width="454" height="500" alt="lydgate" />
  <div class="caption">
    <p>Lydgate presenting a book to the Earl of Salisbury.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="nodent">Thomas Warton has thus exhibited the nature of
his genius: "No poet seems to have possessed
a greater versatility of talents. He moves with
equal ease in every mode of composition. His
hymns and his ballads have the same degree of
merit: and whether his subject be the life of a
hermit or a hero, of Saint Austin or Guy Earl of
Warwick, ludicrous or legendary, religious or romantic,
a history or an allegory, he writes with
facility. His transitions were rapid from works
of the most serious and laborious kind to sallies of
levity and pieces of popular entertainment. His
muse was of universal access, and he was not only
the poet of his monastery, but of the world in
general. If a disguising was intended by the company
of goldsmiths, a mask before his majesty at
Eltham, a May game for the sheriffs and aldermen
of London, a mumming before the lord mayor, a
procession of pageants from the creation for the
festival of Corpus Christi, or a carol for a coronation,
Lydgate was consulted and gave the poetry."
A fine illuminated drawing in one of Lydgate's
manuscripts, now in the British Museum, represents
him presenting a book to the Earl of Salisbury.
Such a presentation may be regarded as
the first publication of a new work. The royal or
noble person at whose command it was written
bestowed some rich gift upon the author, which
would be his sole pecuniary recompence, unless he
received some advantage from the transcribers, for
the copies which they multiplied. Doubtful as the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">{37}</a></span>
rewards of authorship may be when the multiplication
of copies by the press enables each reader to
contribute a small acknowledgment of the benefit
which he receives, the literary condition must have
been far worse when the poet, humbly kneeling
before some mighty man, as Lydgate does in the
picture, might have been dismissed with contumely,
or his present received with a low appreciation of
the labour and the knowledge required to produce
it. The fame, however, of a popular writer reached
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">{38}</a></span>
his ears in a far more direct and flattering manner
than belongs to the literary honours of modern
days. There can be little doubt that the narrative
poems of Chaucer and Gower and Lydgate were
familiar to the people through the recitations of
the minstrels. An agreeable writer on the Rise
and Progress of English Poetry, Mr. George Ellis,
says, "Chaucer, in his address to his Troilus and
Cressida, tells us it was intended to be read 'or
elles sung,' which must relate to the chanting recitation
of the minstrels, and a considerable part of
our old poetry is simply addressed to an audience,
without any mention of readers. That our English
minstrels at any time united all the talents of the
profession, and were at once poets and reciters and
musicians, is extremely doubtful; but that they
excited and directed the efforts of their contemporary
poets to a particular species of composition,
is as evident as that a body of actors must influence
the exertions of theatrical writers. They were, at
a time when reading and writing were rare accomplishments,
the principal medium of communication
between authors and the public; and their
memory in some measure supplied the deficiency of
manuscripts, and probably preserved much of our
early literature till the invention of printing." We
may thus learn, that, although the number of those
was very few whose minds by reading could be
lifted out of the grovelling thoughts and petty cares
of every-day life, yet that the compositions of
learned and accomplished men, who still hold a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">{39}</a></span>
high rank in our literature, might be familiar to
the people through the agency of a numerous body
of singers or reciters. There has been a good deal
of controversy about the exact definition of the
minstrel character—whether the minstrels were
themselves poets and romance-writers, or the depositaries
of the writings of others and of the traditional
literature of past generations. Ritson, a
writer upon this subject, says, "that there were individuals
formerly who made it their business to
wander up and down the country chanting romances,
and singing songs and ballads to the harp,
fiddle, or more humble and less artificial instruments,
cannot be doubted." They were a very numerous
body a century before Chaucer; and most indefatigable
in the prosecution of their trade. There is
a writ or declaration of Edward the Second, which
recites the evil of idle persons, under colour of
minstrelsy, being received in other men's houses
to meat and drink; and then goes on to direct that
to the houses of great people no more than three
or four minstrels of honour should come at the
most in one day, "and to the houses of meaner
men that none come unless he be desired, and such
as shall come to hold themselves contented with
meat and drink, and with such courtesy as the master
of the house will show unto them of his own goodwill,
without their asking of anything." Nothing
can more clearly exhibit the general demand for the
services of this body of men; for the very regulation
as to the nature of their reward shows clearly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">{40}</a></span>
that they were accustomed to require liberal payment,
approaching perhaps to extortion; and then
comes in the State to say that they shall not have
a free market for their labour. They struggled on,
sometimes prosperous and sometimes depressed,
according to the condition of the country, till the
invention of printing came to make popular literature
always present in a man's house. The <i>book</i>
of ballads or romances, which was then to be bought,
was contented to abide there without any "meat and
drink." In the words of Richard de Bury, whom
we quoted in the first chapter, books "are the
masters who instruct us without rods, without hard
words and anger, without clothes and money. If
you approach them, they are not asleep; if investigating
you interrogate them, they conceal
nothing; if you mistake them, they never grumble;
if you are ignorant, they cannot laugh at you."
One of the later ministrels, to whom is ascribed the
preservation, and by some the composition, of the
old ballad of Chevy Chase, thus humbles himself
in a most unpoetical and undignified manner to
those who fed him for his services:—</p>

<div class="verse quote2">"Now for the good cheer that I have had here</div>
<div class="verse">I give you hearty thanks with bowing of my shanks,</div>
<div class="verse">Desiring you by petition to grant me such commission—</div>

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="nodent">But even such a humiliated ballad-maker, or ballad-singer,
as poor old Richard Sheale, was the depositary
of treasures of popular fiction, many of
which have utterly perished, but of which a great
portion of those which are still preserved are delightful
even to the most refined reader. For, corrupted
as they are by transmission from mouth to mouth
through several centuries, they are full of high and
generous sentiments, of deep pathos, of quiet
humour; they carry us back into a state of society
wholly different from our own, when knowledge
was indeed scanty, and riches not very plentiful, but
when the feelings and affections were not so wholly
under the direction of worldly wisdom, and men
were brave and loving, and women tender and confiding,
with something more of earnestness than
belongs to the discreeter arrangements of modern
social life. The minstrels had indeed something to
call up the tear or the smile in every class of auditor.
For the earls and barons, the knights and
squires, there were romances and songs of chivalrous
daring, such as moved the noble heart of Sir Philip
Sidney, even in the days when the minstrel was a
poor despised wanderer: "Is it the Lyric that most
displeaseth, who, with his tuned lyre and well-accorded
voice, giveth praise, the reward of virtue,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">{42}</a></span>
to virtuous acts? who giveth moral precepts and
natural problems? who sometimes raiseth up his
voice to the height of the heavens, in singing the
lauds of the immortal God? Certainly I must confess
mine own barbarousness, I never heard the
old song of Percy and Douglas, that I found not
my heart moved more than with a trumpet, and
yet it is sung but by some blind crowder, with no
rougher voice than rude style." For those of
meaner sort there were the ballads of Robin Hood,
"of whom the foolish vulgar make lewd entertainment,
and are delighted to hear the jesters and
minstrels sing them above all other ballads." So
wrote a Scottish historian in the middle of the
fourteenth century.</p>

<p>We have thus briefly recapitulated the popular
modes of acquiring something of a literary taste in
the early days of William Caxton. Books were
rare, and difficult to be obtained except by the
wealthy. The drama did not exist. The preachers,
indeed, were not afraid to address an indiscriminate
audience with the conviction that, although the
majority were unlettered, they had vigorous understandings,
and did not require the great truths of
religion and of private and of social duty to be
adapted to any intellectual weakness or infirmity.
The national poetry, which was heard at the high
festivals of the city traders, and even descended to
as lowly a popularity as that of the village circle
upon the ale-bench under the spreading elm on
a summer's eve, had no essentials of vulgarity or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">{43}</a></span>
childishness, such as in later days have been
thought necessary for general comprehension. We
were ever a thoughtful people, a reasoning people,
and yet a people of strong passions and unconquerable
energy. A popular literature was kept
alive and preserved, however imperfectly, before the
press came to make those who had learnt to read
self-dependent in their intellectual gratifications;
and what has come down to us of the old minstrelsy,
with all its inaccuracy and occasional feebleness,
shows us that the people of England, four or
five centuries ago, had a common fund of high
thought upon which a great literature might in
time be reared. The very existence of a poet like
Chaucer is the best proof of the vigour, and to a certain
extent of the cultivation, of the national mind,
even in an age when books were rarities.</p>

<p class="nodent"><span class="smc">Robert Large</span>, the master of Caxton, became
Lord Mayor of London in 1439-40. He died in
1441. That he was a man of considerable substance
appears by the record of his bequests, in
Stow's Survey of London: "Robert Large, mercer,
mayor 1440, gave to his parish church of St.
Olave, in Surrey, two hundred pounds; to St.
Margaret's, in Lothbury, twenty-five pounds; to
the poor, twenty pounds; to London-bridge, one
hundred marks; towards the vaulting over the
watercourse of Walbrook, two hundred marks; to
poor maids' marriages, one hundred marks; to
poor householders, one hundred pounds."<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_10" id="Ref_10" href="#Foot_10">[10]</a></span>
By his last will he bequeathed to his servant, William
Caxton, twenty marks, a considerable sum in those
days. From this period it would seem that Caxton
resided abroad. In the first book he translated,
the "Recuyell of the Historyes of Troye," which
bears upon the title to have been "ended and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">{45}</a></span>
finished in the holy city of Cologne, the 19th day of
September, the year of our Lord one thousand,
four hundred, sixty, and eleven," he says, "I have
continued by the space of thirty year for the most
part in the countries of Brabant, Flanders, Holland,
and Zealand." The Rev. John Lewis, who
wrote the Life of Master William Caxton, about a
century ago, says, "It has been guessed that he
was abroad as a travelling agent or factor for the
Company of Mercers, and employed by them in
the business of merchandise." Oldys adds, but
certainly without any authority, "It is agreed on
by those writers who have best acquainted themselves
with his story, he was deputed and intrusted
by the Mercers' Company to be their agent or
factor in Holland, Zealand, Flanders, &amp;c., to
establish and enlarge their correspondents, negociate
the consumption of our own, and importation
of foreign manufactures, and otherwise promote the
advantage of the said corporation in their respective
merchandise." This, indeed, was a goodly
commission, if we can make out that he ever received
such,—an employment which seems to speak
of free and liberal intercourse between two countries,
each requiring the commodities of the other,
and conducting their interchange upon the sound
principles of encouraging mutual consumption, and
thus producing mutual profit. Doubtless, we may
believe, upon a superficial view of the matter, that
the agent of the Mercers' Company was conducting
his operations with the full authority of the government
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">{46}</a></span>
at home, and with the hearty support of the
rulers of the land in which he so long lived. The
real fact is, that for twenty of those years in which
Caxton describes himself as residing in the countries
of Brabant, Holland, and Zealand, there was
an absolute prohibition on both sides of all commercial
intercourse between England and the
Duchy of Burgundy, to which those countries were
subject; and for nearly the whole period, no English
goods were suffered to pass to the continent,
except through the town of Calais; and "in
France," says Caxton, "I was never." If Caxton
had any mercantile employment at all from his
Company, it was, in all probability, for the purpose
of finding channels in trade that were closed up
by the blind policy of the respective governments.
He could not have conducted any mercantile
operation in those countries, except in violation of
the absurd commercial laws which would not allow
the people to seek their own interest in their own
way. It is by no means improbable, however, that
by the connivance of the royal personages who
wanted for themselves rich commodities which they
could only obtain by that exchange which they
denied their subjects, William Caxton was in truth
an accredited smuggler for law-makers who attempted
to limit the wants, and the means of satisfying
the wants, of the people they governed, in
deference to the prejudices of those who thought
that trade could only exist under a system of the
most stringent prohibition.</p>

<div class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">{47}</a></div>

<p>While Edward the Fourth, and Charles the
Good, Duke of Burgundy, were launching against
each other ordinance and enactment to prevent
their subjects becoming exchangers for the better
supply of their respective wants, some politic understanding
between these princes led them eventually
to adopt a wiser system. It is pretty clear
that William Caxton was one of the agents, and a
principal one, in putting an end to a policy which
the Duke of Burgundy said was "evermore to
endure." In 1464 Edward the Fourth issued a
commission to his trusty and well-beloved Richard
Whitehill and William Caxton, to be his especial
ambassadors, procurators, nuncios, and deputies to
his most dear cousin the Duke of Burgundy for
the purpose of confirming an existing treaty of commerce,
or, if necessary, for making a new one. In
1466, this commission being dated in October, 1464,
a treaty was concluded with the Duke of Burgundy,
by which the commerce between his dominions and
England, which had been interrupted for twenty
years, was restored; and a port of Flanders was
subsequently appointed to be a port of the English
staple, as well as Calais. It is pleasant to us to believe
that this extension of a principle which must
eventually bind all nations in a common brotherhood
was effected by the good sense of a mercer
of London; who was afterwards to bestow upon
his country the blessings of an art which has been
the great instrument of that country's progress in
real greatness and prosperity, and before which all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">{48}</a></span>
impediments to the continued course of that prosperity—all
prejudices amongst her own children,
or amongst other peoples, that make the great
family of mankind aliens and enemies, and keep
them from the enjoyment of the advantages which
each might bestow upon the other—will utterly
perish. It is pleasant to us to believe that William
Caxton, the first English printer, in his day opened
the ports of one great trading community to another
great trading community. When he, the mercer's
apprentice, stamped the merchant's mark upon his
master's bales, he knew not, he could not have divined,
that by this process of stamping, carried forward
by the ingenuity of many men into a new art,
there would arise consequences which would change
the face of the world. He could not imagine that
he, whose education had consisted in learning to
buy wool and measure cloth, should, by the natural
course of his commercial life, be thrown into a society
where a great wonder was to fill the minds of
all men with astonishment—the multiplication of
manuscripts by some new and secret process, as if
by magic; and which some men, and he probably
amongst the number, must have regarded with a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">{49}</a></span>
higher feeling than wonder,—with something like
that prophetic view of its consequences which have
been described by the novelist, who, perhaps more
than any man, has employed that art to the delight
of all classes in every country. We refer to the
passage in Sir Walter Scott's Quentin Durward,
where Louis the Eleventh of France, and Martivalle
Galeotti the astrologer, speak of the invention
of printing, and the sage predicts "the lot of a
succeeding generation, on whom knowledge will
descend like the first and second rain, uninterrupted,
unabated, unbounded, fertilizing some grounds, and
overflowing others; changing the whole form of
social life."</p>

<p>In a list of foreign goods forbidden to be imported
into this country by statute of 1464, the
reader might be surprised to find that playing-cards
were of sufficient importance, from their
general use, to require that the native manufactories
should be protected in the production of
them. Playing-cards were known in France for
more than a hundred years before this statute of
Edward IV.; so that the common notion that
they were invented to furnish amusement to an
insane king, Charles VI. of France, about 1393,
is a popular error. It is clear that both in France
and Spain at that period cards were the amusement
not only of the royal and noble inmates of
palaces, but of the burghers and the working
people. The King of Castile, in 1387, prohibited
cards altogether; and they appear, with other
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">{50}</a></span>
games of skill and chance, to have interfered so
much with the regular labour of the artificers of
Paris, that the provost of that city, in 1397, forbade
all working people to play at tennis, bowls,
nine-pins, dice, or cards, on working-days. The
earliest cards were probably painted by means of
a stencil, by which name we call a piece of pasteboard
or plate of thin metal pierced with apertures,
by which a figure is formed upon paper or
other substance beneath it when fluid colour is
smeared over its surface with a brush. But it has
also been conjectured, from their being in the
hands of the working-people, that their cheapness
must have been produced by some rude application
of a wood-engraving to form the outline which the
stencilling process filled up with colour. There
can be no doubt that cards were <i>printed</i> before the
middle of the fifteenth century; for there is a petition
extant from the Venetian <i>painters</i> to their magistracy,
dated 1441, setting forth that the art and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">{51}</a></span>
mystery of card-making and of <i>printing</i> figures,
which were practised in Venice, had fallen into
total decay, through the great quantity of foreign
playing-cards and coloured printed figures which
were brought into the city. The Germans were
the great card-makers of this period; and the name
by which a wood-engraver is still called in Germany,
<i>Formschneider</i>, meaning figure-cutter, occurs
in the town books of Nuremburg as early as
1441. Some of the early cards were very rude.
Here is the Knave of Bells—for spades, diamonds,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">{52}</a></span>
hearts, and clubs were not then the universal
symbols. Others called forth the skill of very
clever artists, such as he who is known as "the
Master of 1466," whose knave is a much more
human knave than the traditionary worthy whom
we look upon to this hour. When Caxton, therefore,
was abroad for thirty years, he would unquestionably
have seen every variety of these painted
bits of paper; some rich with crimson and purple,
oftentimes painted on a golden ground, and calling
forth, like the missals, the highest art of the limner;
others impressed with a rude outline, and daubed
by the stenciller. It appears that the impressions
of the engraved cards, as well as of most of the earlier
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">{53}</a></span>
block-prints, were taken off by friction. This
is the mode by which, even at the present day,
wood-engravers take off the specimen impressions
of their works called proofs. The Chinese produce
their block-books in a similar manner, without the
aid of a press.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p>But there was another application of engraved
blocks, about the same period, which was approaching
still nearer to the art of printing. The representations
of saints and of scriptural histories, which
the limners in the monasteries had for several centuries
been painting in their missals and bibles,
were copied in outline; and being divested of their
brilliant colours and rich gilding, presented figures
exceedingly rude in their want of proportion, and
grotesque in their constrained and violent attitudes.
But they were nevertheless highly popular; and as
the pictures were accompanied with a few sentences
from Scripture, they probably supplied the first
inducement to the laity to learn to read, and thus
prepared the way for that diffusion of knowledge
which was to accompany the invention of printing
from moveable types. In the collection of Earl
Spencer there is a very curious print from a woodblock,
representing St. Christopher carrying the
infant Saviour. This print bears the date 1423.
It is probably not the earliest specimen of the art;
but it is the earliest undoubted document which
determines with precision the period when wood-engraving
was generally applied to objects of devotion.
In a very few years from the date of this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">{54}</a></span>
print the art was carried onward to a more important
object,—that of producing a <i>book</i>.</p>

<p>Several of such books are now in existence, and
are known as block-books. One of them is commonly
called 'Biblia Pauperum,' the Bible of the Poor. But
an ingenious writer on the progress of woodcutting,
in the valuable book on that subject published by
Mr. John Jackson, has shown very clearly that this
was not the original title of the book; and he adds
that it was rather a book for the use of preachers
than the laity:—"A series of skeleton sermons
ornamented with woodcuts to warm the preacher's
imagination, and stored with texts to assist his
memory." This very rare book consists of forty
leaves of small folio, each of which contains a cut
in wood, with extracts from the Scriptures, and
other illustrative sentences. Of other block-books
the most remarkable is called 'Speculum Salutis,'—the
Mirror of Salvation. In this performance
the explanations of the text are much fuller than
in the 'Biblia Pauperum.' In addition to these
works, wooden blocks were also used to print
small manuals of grammar, called Donatuses,
which were used in schools. We present a fac-simile
of a woodcut from one of the early block-books.</p>

  <div class="caption">
    <p>The Wise Men's Offering.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>The use of carved blocks for the multiplication
of copies of playing-cards and devotional pictures
gave birth to a principle which has effected, and
is still effecting, the most important changes in
the world. These devotional pictures had short
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">{56}</a></span>
legends or texts attached to them; and when a
text had to be printed, it was engraved in a solid
piece, as well as the picture. The first person who
seized upon the idea that the text or legend might
be composed of separate letters capable of rearrangement
after the impressions were taken off,
so as to be applied, without new cutting, to other
texts and legends, had secured the principle upon
which the printing art was to depend. It was easy
to extend the principle from a few lines to a whole
page, and from one page to many, so as to form a
book; but then were seen the great labour and
expense of cutting so many separate letters upon
small pieces of wood or metal, and another step was
required to be made before the principle was
thoroughly worked out. This step consisted in the
ready multiplication of the separate letters by casting
metal in moulds. Lastly, instead of using the
old Chinese mode of friction to produce impressions,
a <i>press</i> was to be perfected. All these gradations
were undoubtedly the result of long and patient
experiments carried on by several individuals, who
each saw the importance of the notion they were
labouring to work out. It is this circumstance
which has given rise to interminable controversies
as to the inventors of printing, some claiming the
honour for Coster of Haarlem, and some for Guttenberg
of Mentz; and, as is usual in all such disputes,
it was represented that the man to whom
public opinion had assigned the credit of the invention
had stolen it from another, who, as is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">{57}</a></span>
also usual in these cases, thought of it in a dream,
or received it by some other mysterious revelation.
The general consent of Europe now assigns the
chief honour to Guttenberg.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_11" id="Ref_11" href="#Foot_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p>During the summer of 1837 a statue of John
Guttenberg, by Thorwaldsen, was erected at Mentz
(or Mayence), and on the 14th of August and the
following days a festival was held there, upon the
occasion of the inauguration of the monument.
Abundant evidence has been brought forward of
late years to show that Guttenberg deserves all the
honours of having conceived, and in great part perfected,
an art which has produced the most signal
effects upon the destinies of mankind. At that
festival of Mentz, at which many hundred persons
were assembled, from all parts of Europe, to do
honour to the inventor of printing, no rival pretensions
were put forward; although many of the compatriots
of Coster of Haarlem were present. The
fine statue of Guttenberg was opened amidst an
universal burst of enthusiasm. Never were the
shouts of a vast multitude raised on a more elevating
occasion;—never were the triumphs of intellect
celebrated with greater fervour.</p>

<p>Passing his life amidst the ceaseless activity that
belongs to the commerce of literature in London,
the writer of this volume felt no common interest
in the enthusiasm which the festival in honour of
Guttenberg called forth throughout Germany; and
he determined to attend that celebration. The fine
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">{58}</a></span>
statue which was to be opened to public view on
the 14th of August had been erected by a general
subscription, to which all Europe was invited to
contribute. We apprehend that the English,
amidst the incessant claims upon their attention for
the support of all sorts of undertakings, whether of
a national or individual character, had known little
of the purpose which the good citizens of Mentz
had been advocating with unabated zeal for several
years;—and perhaps the object itself was not calculated
to call forth any very great liberality on the
part of those who are often directed in their bounties
as much by fashion as by their own convictions.
Thus it is that we have monuments out of number
to warriors. Caxton has no monument; neither
has Shakspere. Be that as it may, England
literally gave nothing towards the statue of a man
whose invention has done as much as any other
single cause to make England what she is. The
remoteness of the cause may also have lessened its
importance; and some people, who, without any
deserts of their own, are enjoying a more than full
share of the blessings which have been shed upon
us by the progress of intellect (which determines
the progress of national wealth), have a sort of instinctive
notion that the spread of knowledge is the
spread of something inimical to the pretensions of
mere riches. We met with a lady on board the
steamboat ascending the Rhine, two days before
the festival of Mentz, who, whilst she gave us an
elaborate account of the fashionable dulness of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">{59}</a></span>
baths of Baden and Nassau, and all the other German
watering-places, told us by all means to avoid
Mentz during the following week, as a crowd of
low people from all parts would be there, to make
a great fuss about a printer who had been dead two
or three hundred years. The low people did assemble
in great crowds: it was computed that at
least fifteen thousand strangers had arrived to do
honour to the first printer.</p>

<p>The modes in which a large population displays
its enthusiasm are pretty much the same throughout
the world. If the sentiment which collects
men together be very heart-stirring, all the outward
manifestations of the sentiment harmonize
with its real truth. Thus, processions, and orations,
and public dinners, and pageantries which in
themselves are vain and empty, are important when
the persons whom they collect together have one
common feeling which for the time is all-pervading.
We never saw such a popular fervour as prevailed
at Mentz at the festival of August, 1837. The
statue was to be opened on Monday the 14th; but
on the Sunday evening the name of Guttenberg
was rife through all the streets. In the morning
all Mentz was in motion by six o'clock; and at
eight a procession was formed to the Cathedral,
which, if it was not much more imposing than
some of the processions of trades in London and
other cities, was conducted with a quiet precision
which evidenced that the people felt they were engaged
in a solemn act. The fine old Cathedral was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">{60}</a></span>
crowded;—the Bishop of Mentz performed high
Mass;—the first Bible printed by Guttenberg was
displayed. What a field for reflection was here
opened! The first Bible, in connexion with the
imposing pageantries of Roman Catholicism—the
Bible, in great part a sealed book to the body of the
people; the service of God in a tongue unknown
to the larger number of worshippers;—but that
first Bible the germ of millions of Bibles that have
spread the light of Christianity throughout all the
habitable globe! The Mass ended, the procession
again advanced to the adjacent square, where the
statue was to be opened. Here was erected a vast
amphitheatre, where, seated under their respective
banners, were deputations from all the great cities
of Europe. Amidst salvos of artillery the veil was
removed from the statue, and a hymn was sung
by a thousand voices. Then came orations;—then
dinners—balls—oratorios—boat-races—processions
by torchlight. For three days the population of
Mentz was kept in a state of high excitement;
and the echo of the excitement went through Germany,—and
Guttenberg! Guttenberg! was toasted
in many a bumper of Rhenish wine amidst this
cordial and enthusiastic people.</p>

<p>And, indeed, even in one who could not boast of
belonging to the land in which printing was invented,
the universality of the mighty effects of
this art, when rightly considered, would produce
almost a corresponding enthusiasm. It is difficult
to look upon the great changes that have been effected
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">{61}</a></span>
during the last four centuries, and which are
still in progress everywhere around us, and not connect
them with printing and with its inventor.
The castles on the Rhine, under whose ruins we
travelled back from Mentz, perished before the
powerful combinations of the people of the towns.
The petty feudal despots fell, when the burghers
had acquired wealth and knowledge. But the progress
of despotism upon a larger scale could not
have been arrested had the art of Guttenberg not
been discovered. The strongholds of military
power still frown over the same majestic river.
The Rhine has seen its pretty fortresses crumble
into decay;—Ehrenbreitstein is more strong than
ever. But even Ehrenbreitstein will fall before
the power of mind. The Rhine is crowded with
steamboats, where the feudal lord once levied tribute
upon the frail bark of the fisherman; and the
approaches to the Rhine from all Germany, and
from France and Belgium, have become a great
series of railroads. Such communications will make
war a game much more difficult to play; and when
mankind are thoroughly civilized, it will never be
played again. Seeing, then, what intellect has
done and is doing, we may well venerate the memory
of Guttenberg of Mentz.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IV.</h3>

<p class="gist">The Court of Burgundy—Caxton a Translator—Literature of Chivalry—Feudal
Times—Caxton at the Ducal Court—Did Caxton print
at Bruges—Edward the Fugitive—The new Art.</p>

<p class="nodent"><span class="smc">The</span> "most dear" Duke of Burgundy, with whom
Caxton was appointed to negotiate in 1464, was
Philip, surnamed the Good. He was a wise and
peaceful prince, and honourably earned his title.
We know not whether Caxton was in immediate
attendance upon the court of Philip from the commencement
of his mission until the death of the
duke in 1467; but the evidence is subsequently
clear that he was about the court in some office of
trust after the succession to the dukedom of the
eldest son of Philip, the Count of Charolois. The
character of this prince was entirely opposed to
that of his father; and he acquired the name of
Charles le Téméraire, or the Rash. This fiery
prince, whose influence in that warlike age was
perhaps greater than the benignant power of his
father, was not likely to have looked very favourably
upon an envoy from Edward of England: for
he was allied by blood on his mother's side to the
house of Lancaster, and was consequently opposed
to the fortunes of the house of York. The court
of Burgundy was the resort of many of the adherents
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">{63}</a></span>
of that unhappy house, who had fled from
England after many a vain struggle with the triumphant
Edward. These fugitives are described
by Comines "as young gentlemen whose fathers
had been slain in England, whom the Duke of
Burgundy had generously entertained as his relations
of the house of Lancaster." Comines adds,
"Some of them were reduced to such extremity of
want and poverty before the Duke of Burgundy
received them, that no common beggar could have
been in greater; I saw one of them, who was Duke
of Exeter (but he concealed his name), following
the Duke of Burgundy's train bare-foot and barelegged,
begging his bread from door to door: this
person was the next of the house of Lancaster;
had married King Edward's sister: and being afterwards
known, had a small pension allowed him for
his subsistence. There were also some of the
family of the Somersets, and several others, all of
them slain since, in the wars." But the policy of
Charles of Burgundy, after his accession to the
dukedom, led him to consider the ties of ancient
friendship as of far less importance than the
strengthening of his hand by an alliance with the
successful house of York. Within a year of his
accession he married Margaret, sister of Edward
IV. Comines says this marriage "was principally
to strengthen his alliance against the king of
France, otherwise he would never have done it, for
the love he bore to the house of Lancaster." The
establishment of Margaret as Duchess of Burgundy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">{64}</a></span>
gave a direction to the fortunes of William Caxton,
and was in all likelihood the proximate cause that
<i>he</i> was our first English printer.</p>

<p>Margaret Plantagenet was married to Charles
of Burgundy at the city of Bruges, on the 3rd
of July, 1468. We have the distinct evidence of
Caxton that he was residing at Bruges some months
previous to the marriage; that he had little to do;
and that he employed his leisure in literary pursuits.
In his 'Recuyell of the Historyes of Troye'
it is stated in the title-page, "which said translation
and work was begun in Bruges, in the county
of Flanders, the first day of March, the year of the
Incarnation a thousand, four hundred, sixty and
eight." The prologue begins as follows:—"When
I remember that every man is bounden by the commandment
and counsel of the wise man to eschew
sloth and idleness, which is mother and nourisher
of vices, and ought to put myself unto virtuous
occupation and business, then I, having no great
charge or occupation, following the said counsel,
took a French book and read therein many strange
marvellous histories, wherein I had great pleasure
and delight, as well for the novelty of the same, as
for the fair language of the French, which was in
prose so well and compendiously set and written,
methought I understood the sentence and substance
of every matter. And for so much as this book
was new and late made and drawn into French,
and never had seen it in our English tongue, I
thought in myself it should be a good business to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">{65}</a></span>
translate it into our English, to the end that it
might be had as well in the royaume of England
as in other lands, and also for to pass therewith the
time, and thus concluded in myself to begin this
said work, and forthwith took pen and ink, and
began boldly to run forth, as blind Bayard, in this
present work."</p>

<p>Philip de Comines, speaking of the prosperity of
the people at the time of the accession of Charles,
says, "The subjects of the house of Burgundy
lived at that time in great plenty and prosperity,
grew proud and wallowed in riches.... The
expenses and habits both of women and men were
great and extravagant; their entertainments and
banquets more profuse and splendid than in any
other place that I ever saw." The city of Bruges
was then the great seat of this wealth and luxury.
The Flemish nobles lived here in mansions of
striking architecture, some traces of which still
remain. The merchants vied with the nobles in
tasteful magnificence. The canals of Bruges were
crowded with boats laden with the richest treasures
of distant lands. It was commerce that made the
inhabitants of Bruges, of Ghent, and the other
great Flemish towns so rich and powerful; and the
same commerce was the encourager of art, which
even at this early period displayed itself amongst
a people naturally disposed for its cultivation.
Charles the Rash destroyed much of this prosperity
by his aptitude for war. But in the onset
of his career he fought with all the pomp and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">{66}</a></span>
graces of the old chivalry, and his court was the
seat of such romantic pageantries that John Paston,
an Englishman who went over with Margaret of
York, writes, "As for the duke's court, as for
lords, ladies, and gentlewomen, knights, esquires,
and gentlemen, I heard never of none like to it save
King Arthur's court." It was here, without doubt,
that William Caxton, the yeoman's son of the
Weald of Kent, and afterwards the mercer's apprentice
of the city of London, acquired that love
for the literature of chivalry which he displays on
many occasions in his office of translator and printer.
Here he made acquaintances that led him to the
study of the romance-writers, as for example of a
worthy canon of whom he writes, "Oft times I
have been excited of the venerable man Messire
Henry Bolomyer canon of Lausanne, for to reduce
for his pleasure some histories, as well in Latin
and in romance as in other fashion written; that
is to say, of the right puissant, virtuous, and noble
Charles the Great, King of France and Emperor
of Rome, son of the great Pepin, and of his princes
and barons, as Rowland, Oliver, and other." His
zeal for this species of literature left him not in his
latest years: for in his translation of 'The Book of
the Order of Chivalry,' which was printed by him
about 1484, he rises into absolute eloquence in his
address at the conclusion of the volume: "Oh, ye
knights of England, where is the custom and usage
of noble chivalry that was used in those days?
What do ye now, but go to the baynes [baths] and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">{67}</a></span>
play at dice? And some, not well advised, use
not honest and good rule, against all order of
knighthood. Leave this, leave it! and read the
noble volumes of St. Graal, of Lancelot, of Galaad,
of Trystram, of Perse Forest, of Percyval, of
Gawayn, and many more: there shall ye see manhood,
courtesy, and gentleness. And look in latter
days of the noble acts sith the Conquest, as in King
Richard days Cœur de Lion, Edward I., and
III. and his noble sons, Sir Robert Knolles, Sir
John Hawkwode, Sir John Chandos, and Sir
Gueltiare Manny. Read Froissart; and also behold
that victorious and noble King Harry V.,
and the captains under him, his noble brethren
the earls of Salisbury, Montagu, and many other,
whose names shine gloriously by their virtuous
noblesse and acts that they did in the honour of
the order of chivalry. Alas, what do ye but sleep
and take ease, and are all disordered from chivalry?"
Caxton was dazzled, as many others were,
with the bravery and the generosity of the chivalric
character. He did not see the cruelty and
pride, the oppression and injustice, that lurked beneath
the glittering armour and the velvet mantle.
Yet he was amongst those who first helped to
destroy the gross inequality upon which chivalry
was founded, by raising up the middle classes to
the possession of knowledge. There were scenes
transacting at Bruges, even at the very hour when
Margaret of York came to give her hand to Charles
of Burgundy, that must have shown him what
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">{68}</a></span>
fearful passions were too often the companions of
the courage and graces of knighthood.</p>

<p>At the midsummer of 1468 Bruges presented a
scene of magnificence that was probably unequalled
in those days of costly display. On the occasion of
the approaching marriage, the nobility of Charles's
extensive dominions arrived from every quarter.
Ambassadors were there from all Christian powers.
It looked like an occasion on which men should
forget that there was such a thing as war in the
world; and when despotism should put on its
blandest smile and its most courteous reverence
for all orders of men. The Duke of Burgundy
anxiously desired the presence of the Count de St.
Pôl, the great Constable of France. The constable
arrived, surrounded with every pomp that his pride
could devise,—with trumpets and banners, with
pages on foot and crowds of horsemen, and a naked
sword borne before him as the symbol of sovereignty.
Charles was irritated beyond measure,
and refused to receive the great lord, who from
that hour became his deadliest enemy. But there
was something more tragic to be enacted in the
midst of a population looking only for high
triumphs and royal pleasures. One of the chamberlains
of the Duke of Burgundy was an illegitimate
son of the Lord of Condé; he was very
young, of exceeding beauty, and the most agreeable
manners. He had fought by the side of the duke
at the battle of Montlhéry, and was one of his
most especial favourites. The youth, with that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">{69}</a></span>
ferocious self-abandonment which was not incompatible
with the gentlest manners in courts and
the noblest honours in camps, committed a murder
under circumstances of extraordinary aggravation.
He was playing at tennis, and, the fairness of a
stroke being doubtful, a bystander was called upon
to decide. Deciding against the Bastard of Condé,
the young man swore that he would be revenged.
The bystander, who was a canon of the church,
fled to his home, and the furious youth pursued
him. The canon escaped, but his brother encountered
the madman. Some victim must be offered
up to appease his selfish rage, and the brother was
in his path. The wretched man fell on his knees,
and, clasping his hands, begged for mercy. Those
uplifted hands were cut off in an instant, and the
sword that had been honourably drawn at Montlhéry,
pierced the breast of an unoffending citizen.
Such a murder could not pass unnoticed; and yet
the young man's friends did not doubt that he
would go unpunished, for he had committed the
crime in his father's lordship. Such crimes were
often committed with impunity by the great and
the powerful; and even the commonalty were unprepared
to expect any heavier punishment than a
pecuniary recompense to the relations of the murdered
man. The duke, however, had taken his
determination. The Bastard of Condé was held in
arrest at the house of the gatekeeper of the city of
Bruges. Charles was solicited on every side for
pardon, and even the relations of the deceased,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">{70}</a></span>
having been moved by suitable presents, supplicated
his release; but the duke kept the matter in
suspense till Bruges was filled with his subjects
from every part of his dominions, and especially
with the most powerful of his nobles. At the instant
that he was ready to depart to meet the Lady
Margaret at the neighbouring port of Ecluse, he
commanded that the young man should be taken
to the common prison, and the next morning led
to execution. Even the magistrate of the city to
whom this command was intrusted thought it impossible
that the duke should execute one so highly
connected, as if he were a common offender. The
execution was delayed several hours by the magistrate
in the hope that the duke would relent; but
no respite came. The youth was carried through
the city to the place of execution, amidst the tears
of the people, who forgot his crime in his beauty.
He was beheaded, and his body divided into four
quarters. The Lord of Condé and his adherents
left the city vowing vengeance. The nobles assembled
felt themselves outraged by this exercise
of absolute power. Even the citizens attributed the
stern decree of the duke to his indomitable pride
rather than to his love of justice. Such was the
prelude to the bridal festivities of the court of Burgundy;
of which one who wrote an especial description
in Latin says, "The sun never shone upon a
more splendid ceremony since the creation of the
world."</p>

<p>There can be no doubt that Caxton was in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">{71}</a></span>
direct employ of Margaret, Duchess of Burgundy.
What he has told us himself of his position in her
court is far more interesting than all the conjectures
which his biographers have exercised upon the
matter. He was in an honourable position, he
was treated with confidence, he was grateful. We
have already given an extract from the prologue to
his 'Recuyell of the Historyes of Troye,' which
shows when and under what circumstances he
commenced the translation of that work. Remembering
his simpleness and unperfectness in the
French and English languages (which passage we
have already noticed), he continues: "When all
these things came before me, after that I had
made and written five or six quires, I fell in despair
of this work, and purposed no more to have
continued therein, and the quires laid apart; and
in two years after laboured no more at this work,
and was fully in will to have left it. Till on a
time it fortuned that the right high, excellent, and
right virtuous princess, my right redoubted lady,
my Lady Margaret"—and then he gives her a host
of titles—"sent for me to speak with her good
grace of divers matters, among the which I let her
highness have knowledge of the aforesaid beginning
of this work; which anon commanded me to shew
the said five or six quires to her said grace. And
when she had seen them, anon she found defaute
[fault] in mine English, which she commanded
me to amend, and moreover commanded me
straightly [immediately] to continue and make an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">{72}</a></span>
end of the residue then not translated. Whose
dreadful commandment I durst in no wise disobey,
because I am a servant unto her said grace, and
receive of her yearly fee, and other many good and
great benefits, and also hope many more to receive
of her highness; but forthwith went and laboured
in the said translation after my simple and poor
cunning, all so nigh as I can following mine author,
meekly beseeching the bounteous highness of my
said lady, that of her benevolence list to accept and
take in gree [take kindly] this simple and rude
work." The picture which Caxton thus presents
to us of his showing his translation with an author's
diffidence to the "dreadful" duchess, her criticism
of his English, and her very flattering command
that in spite of all its faults he should make an
end of his work, is as interesting as Froissart's
account of his literary recreations with Gaston de
Foix:—"The acquaintance of him and of me was
because I had brought with me a book, which I
made at the contemplation of Winceslaus of Bohemia,
Duke of Luxembourg and of Brabant,
which work was called 'Meliador,' containing all
the songs, ballads, rondeaux, and virelays which
the gentle duke had made in this time, which by
imagination I had gathered together; which book
the Count of Foix was glad to see. And every
night after supper I read therein to him; and
while I read there was none durst speak any word,
because he would I should be well understood,
wherein he took great solace." In both cases the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">{73}</a></span>
men of letters were received on a free and familiar
footing in the courtly circles. In the case of Caxton
this was even more honourable to the Lady
Margaret, than the welcome which Gaston de
Foix gave to the accomplished knight Sir John
Froissart. Caxton had no knightly honours to
recommend him; he was a plain merchant: but
he was unquestionably a man of modesty and intelligence;
he had travelled much; he was familiar
with the most popular literature of his day; and
he desired to extend the knowledge of it by translations
into his native language. It is difficult to
say what was his exact employment in the court
of the Lady Margaret. He was somewhat too old
to partake of its light amusements, to mingle in its
gallantries, or even to prompt my lady's fool with
some word of wisdom. We have seen that four
months before Margaret of York came to Bruges
he had "no great charge or occupation," and he
undertook the translation of a considerable work
"for to pass therewith the time." It has, however,
been maintained of late years, that Caxton was at
this very time a printer. The question is a curious
one, and we may bestow a little space upon its examination.</p>

<p>Mr. Hallam, in his 'Literature of Europe,' noticing
the progress of printing, says that several books
were printed in Paris in 1470 and 1471, adding,
"But there seem to be unquestionable proofs that
a still earlier specimen of typography is due to an
English printer, the famous Caxton. His 'Recueil
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">{74}</a></span>
des Histoires de Troye' appears to have been
printed during the life of Philip, Duke of Burgundy,
and consequently before June 15, 1467.
The place of publication, certainly within the
duke's dominions, has not been conjectured. It
is, therefore, by several years the earliest printed
book in the French language. A Latin speech by
Russell, ambassador of Edward IV. to Charles of
Burgundy, in 1469, is the next publication of Caxton.
This was also printed in the Low Countries."
The authority upon which the learned and accomplished
historian of the Middle Ages relies for this
statement is that of Mr. Dibdin, in his 'Typographical
Antiquities.' The French edition of the
'Recueil des Histoires de Troye' bears no printer's
name, date, or place. It purports to have been
composed by Raoul le Fevre, chaplain to Duke
Philip de Bourgoyne, in the year 1464. The evidence
that this book was printed by Caxton was
summed up by Mr. Bryant, and communicated by
him to Mr. Herbert, the first editor of Ames's
'Typographical Antiquities.' The Rev. Mr. Dibdin,
the second editor, says that these memoranda
of Mr. Bryant's "clearly prove it to have been the
production of Caxton." The argument rests upon
these points: that the French and English editions
of Le Fevre's work have an exact conformity and
likeness throughout, for not only the page itself,
but the number of lines in a page, the length,
breadth, and intervals of the lines, are alike in both,
and the letters, great and small, are of the same
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">{75}</a></span>
magnitude. It corresponds too with 'The Game of
the Chess,' printed by Caxton in England, in 1474.
"These considerations," says Mr. Bryant, "settle
who the printer was." We venture to doubt this.
Mr. Bryant has himself shown how this resemblance
might be produced between books printed by Caxton,
and books supposed to be printed by him,
without Caxton being the actual printer. "Mentz
was taken by the Duke of Saxony in the year 1462,
and most of the artificers employed by John Fust,
the great inventor, were dispersed abroad. I make
no doubt but Caxton, who was at no great distance
from Mentz, took this opportunity of making himself
a master of the mystery, which he had been
at much trouble and expense to obtain. This I
imagine he effected by taking into pay some of
Fust's servants, and settling them for a time at
Cologne. Of this number probably were Pinson
and Rood, Mechlin, Lettou, and Wynkyn de Worde.
With the help of some of these, he printed the
book [which Wynkyn de Worde says Caxton
printed] 'Bartholomeus de Prop. Rerum,' and the
translation of the 'Recueil;' and probably many
other books, which, being either in French or Latin,
were not vendible in our country, and consequently
no copies are extant here. Of all the books he
printed in England, I do not remember above one
in a foreign language." The calamity which drove
the printers of Mentz from their homes, the storming
of the city by Adolphus of Nassau, would naturally
disperse their types, as well as break up
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">{76}</a></span>
their workshops. The resemblance between the
doubtful books, and books undoubtedly printed by
Caxton, was the resemblance of types cast in the
same matrices; the spaces between the lines, as
well as the form and magnitude of the letters, were
produced by the letters being cast in the same
mould. The resemblance would have been equally
produced whether the types were used by one and
the same printer, or by two printers. The typographical
antiquarians say that the same types are
used in the French and English works of Le Fevre
and in Caxton's 'Game of Chess;' and Mr. Herbert
adds, that the types are the same as those
used by Fust and Schoeffer, the partners of Guttenberg.
If the resemblance of types were sufficient
to determine the printer of two or more books, then
Fust and Schoeffer ought to be called the printers
of the French 'Recueil,' as well as of the English
translation which Caxton says he printed at
Cologne. There can be little doubt that, when
Caxton went to Cologne to be a printer in 1471,
he became possessed of the types and matrices with
which he printed his translation of Le Fevre, and
subsequently brought to England to print his
'Game of Chess.' Another printer might have
preceded him in their possession, and might have
received them direct from Fust and Schoeffer.
When the art ceased to be a mystery, a profit
might arise from selling the types or multiplying
the matrices. Upon these considerations we wholly
demur to the assertion, resting solely upon this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">{77}</a></span>
resemblance, that Caxton was a printer during the
life of Philip le Bon. The belief is entirely opposed
to his own statement, that shortly after the
death of this prince he was completely at leisure,
and set about a translation to while away his time.
To be a printer in those days was a mighty undertaking.
We shall subsequently see that he declares
that he had practised and learnt the art at
great charge and expense. It is wholly unlikely,
also, that so gossiping a man, who makes a familiar
friend of his readers, telling them of almost every
circumstance that led to the printing of every book,
that he in his translation should not have said one
word of being the printer of the original work.
The other book, the Latin speech by Russell, in
1469, which has been called the second publication
of Caxton, is attributed to him absolutely upon no
other grounds than the same resemblance of type.
Assuredly we cannot receive the fact of resemblance
as conclusive of Caxton being the printer
either in this case or in that of the preceding. He
tells us that in 1470 he was a servant receiving
yearly fee from the Duchess of Burgundy, and completed
an extensive work at her command, which
he simply began "to eschew sloth and idleness,"
and to put himself "unto virtuous occupation and
business." When he did fairly become a printer,
he left sufficiently clear indications of his habitual
industry. We have no question how he filled up
his time when the press at Westminster was at
work.</p>

<div class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">{78}</a></div>

<p>It was in the autumn of 1470, when Master
William Caxton would appear to have been busily
labouring in some silent turret of the palace at
Bruges, upon his translation of Raoul le Fevre,
that an event occurred, of all others the most calculated
to spread consternation in the court of
Burgundy, and to make the bold duke feel that in
abandoning his family alliance with the house of
Lancaster he had not done the politic thing which
he anticipated. Edward IV., who had sat for some
years with tolerable quiet upon the English throne,
to which he had fought his way in many a battlefield
with prodigious bravery, suddenly arrived at
Bruges, in the October of 1470, a discrowned fugitive.
He made his escape from the overwhelming
inroad of the power of Warwick, "attended,"
says Comines, "by seven or eight hundred men
without any clothes but what they were to have
fought in, no money in their pockets, and not one
in twenty of them knew whither they were going."
He, the most beautiful man of the time, as Comines
describes him,—who for twelve or thirteen years
of prosperity had lived a life of the most luxurious
gratification,—he arrived at Bruges, after being
chased by privateers, and with difficulty rescued
from their hands, so poor that he "was forced to
give the master of the ship for his passage a gown
lined with martens." At Bruges, then, did this
fugitive remain nearly five months, when he again
leaped into his throne, in the following April, with
a triumphant boldness which has only one parallel
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">{79}</a></span>
in modern history,—that of the march of Napoleon
from Elba. In May, 1471, he addressed a letter
in French to the nobles and burgomasters of
Bruges, thanking them for the courtesy and hospitality
he had received from them during his exile.
Edward was of a sanguine temper; and, however
depressed in fortune, was not likely, during those
five months of humiliation, to have doubted that in
good time he should regain the throne. He was
of an easy and communicative disposition; and
would naturally confer with his sister and her confidential
servants upon his plans and prospects.
Comines says, "King Edward told me that, in all
the battles which he had gained, his way was, when
the victory was on his side, to mount on horseback,
and cry out to save the common soldiers, and put
the gentry to the sword." We mention this to
show that he was not indisposed to talk of himself
and his doings with those whom he met during his
exile. It is more than probable, then, that he had
the same sort of free communication with his
countryman Caxton. It was at this period that
the progress of the art of printing must have been
a subject of universal interest The merchants of
Bruges had commercial intercourse with all the
countries of Europe; and they would naturally
bring to the court of Burgundy some specimens of
that art which was already beginning to create a
new description of commerce. From Mentz, Bamberg,
Cologne, Strasburg, and Augsburg, they
would bring some of the Latin and German bibles
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">{80}</a></span>
which, from 1461 to 1470, had issued from the
presses of those cities. The presses of Italy, and
especially of Rome, of Venice, and of Milan, had,
during the same period, sent forth books, and more
particularly classical works, in great abundance.
The art had made such rapid progress in Italy,
that in the first edition of St. Jerome's Epistles,
printed in 1468, the Bishop of Aleria thus addresses
Pope Paul II.: "It was reserved for the times of
your holiness for the Christian world to be blessed
with the immense advantages resulting from the
art of printing; by means of which, and with a
little money, the poorest person may collect together
a few books. It is a small testimony of the
glory of your holiness, that the volumes which
formerly scarcely an hundred golden crowns would
purchase may now be procured for twenty and
less, and these well-written and authentic ones."
It is pretty clear that Caxton, when he began his
translation of the 'Histories of Troye,' had some
larger circulation in view than could be obtained
by the medium of transcription: "I thought in
myself it should be a good business to translate it
into our English, to the end that it might be had
as well in the royaume of England as in other
lands." It is also probable that he was moving
about in search of the best mode of printing it;
for he says, at the end of the second book of the
'Recueil,' "And for as much as I suppose the said
two books be not had before this time in our
English language, therefore I had the better will
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">{81}</a></span>
to accomplish the said work; which work was
begun in Bruges, and continued in Gaunt [Ghent],
and finished in Cologne, in time of the troublous
world, and of the great divisions being and reigning
as well in the royaumes of England and France
as in all other places universally through the world,
that is to wit, the year of our Lord one thousand,
four hundred, and seventy-one." But he further
says, with reference to his translation of the third
book, which he doubted about doing, "because that
I have now good leisure, being in Cologne, and
have none other thing to do at this time in eschewing
of idleness, mother of all vices, I have deliberated
in myself of the contemplation of my said
redoubted lady, to take this labour in hand." We
shall presently see when Caxton became, or at any
rate avowed himself to have become, a printer.
Up to this point we see him only as a translator, a
man of leisure, and not one learning a new and
difficult craft. But we see him moving about from
Bruges to Ghent, from Ghent to Cologne, without
any distinct or specified object. There can be little
doubt, we believe, that he was endeavouring to
make himself acquainted with the new art, still in
great measure a secret art, the masters of which
required to be approached with considerable caution.
That the presence of Edward IV. in Flanders,
during a period when Caxton might readily
have had access to his person, might have led him
to believe that the time would come when, under
the patronage of the restored prince, he might carry
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">{82}</a></span>
the art to London, is not an improbable conjecture.
Amongst the companions of Edward's exile was
his brother-in-law, the celebrated Lord Rivers.
This brave and accomplished young nobleman subsequently
translated a book called 'The Dictes and
Sayings of Philosophers,' which Caxton printed at
Westminster, in 1477. The printer has added an
appendix to this translation, from which we collect
that the noble author and his literary printer were
upon terms of mutual confidence and regard: "At
such time as he had accomplished this said work,
it liked him to send it to me in certain quires to
oversee.... And so afterward I came unto my
said lord, and told him how I had read and seen
his book, and that he had done a meritorious deed
in the labour of the translation thereof....
Then my said lord desired me to oversee it, and,
where as I should find fault, to correct it, wherein
I answered unto his lordship that I could not
amend it.... Notwithstanding he willed me
to oversee it." Earl Rivers, then Lord Scales, was
also at Bruges upon the occasion of the Lady Margaret's
marriage. Employed, therefore, by the
Duchess of Burgundy, the sister of Edward IV.,
and honoured with the confidence of Earl Rivers,
his brother-in-law, we may reasonably believe that
the presence of Edward at Bruges in 1470-71
might have had some influence upon the determination
of Caxton to learn and practise the new art
of printing, and to carry it into England, if the
"troublous times" could afford him occasion. We
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">{83}</a></span>
have distinct evidence that Edward IV. gave a
marked encouragement to the labours of Caxton
as a translator, in a book printed by him without
any date, 'The Life of Jason,' written, as were the
'Histories of Troy,' by Raoul le Fevre, in which
Caxton says in his prologue, "For as much as late
by the commandment of the right high and noble
princess my Lady Margaret, &amp;c., I translated a
book out of French into English, named 'Recueil,'
&amp;c.... Therefore, under the protection and
sufferance of the most high, puissant, and Christian
king, my most dread natural liege, Lord Edward,
&amp;c., I intend to translate the said book of the 'Histories
of Jason.'" The expression "for as much as
late by the commandment, &amp;c.," brings the date of
the 'Histories of Jason' close to that of the 'Histories
of Troy' and points out the probability
that the protection and sufferance of Edward was
afforded to Caxton when the king was a fugitive at
the court of Burgundy. In the 'Issues of the Exchequer,'
there is the following entry of a payment
on the 15th of June, in the 19th of Edward IV.,
"To William Caxton, in money paid to his own
hands, in discharge of twenty pounds which the
lord the king commanded to be paid to the same
William for certain causes and matters performed
by him for the said lord the king." This is eight
years after the period of Edward's exile, being in
1479. But as the productions of Caxton's press
were very prolific at this time, we may believe
that the payment of such a large sum for certain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">{84}</a></span>
causes and matters performed for the king was
in some degree connected with his labours in
the introduction of printing into England,—a
payment not improbably postponed for obligations
incurred, and promises granted, at an earlier
period.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER V.</h3>

<p class="gist">Rapidity of Printing—Who the first English Printer—Caxton the
first English Printer—First English Printed Book—Difficulties
of the first Printers—Ancient Bookbinding—The Printer a
Publisher—Conditions of Cheapness in Books.</p>

<p class="nodent"><span class="smc">At</span>
the end of the third book of Caxton's translation
of the 'Recuyell of the Historyes of Troye,'
which we have so often quoted, is the following
most curious passage: "Thus end I this book,
which I have translated after mine author, as nigh
as God hath given me cunning, to whom be given
the laud and praises. And for as much as in the
writing of the same my pen is worn, mine hand
weary and not stedfast, mine eyen dimmed with
overmuch looking on the white paper, and my
courage not so prone and ready to labour as it hath
been, and that age creepeth on me daily and
feebleth all the body; and also because I have
promised to divers gentlemen and to my friends to
address to them as hastily as I might this said
book, therefore I have practised and learned, at
my great charge and dispense [expense], to ordain
this said book in print, after the manner and form
as you may here see; and is not written with pen
and ink as other books are, to the end that every
man may have them at once. For all the books
of this story named the 'Recuyell of the Historyes
of Troye,' thus imprinted as ye here see, were begun
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">{86}</a></span>
in one day, and also finished in one day.
Which book I presented to my said redoubted lady
as afore is said, and she hath well accepted it and
largely rewarded me." It was customary for the
first printers, which is not according to the belief
that they wanted to palm their printed books off as
manuscripts, to state that they were not drawn or
written with a pen and ink. Udalricus Gallus,
who printed at Rome about 1470, says, "I, Udalricus
Gallus, without pen or pencil have imprinted
this book." But he further says of himself at the
end of one of his books,—"I printed thus much
in a day; it is not written in a year." It has been
held that Caxton uses a purely marvellous and
hyperbolical mode of expression, when he says,
"All the books of this story, thus imprinted as
ye here see, were begun in one day and finished
in one day." Dr. Dibdin inquires what Caxton
meant "by saying that the book was begun and
finished in one day? Did he wish his countrymen
to believe that the translation of Le Fevre's book
was absolutely printed in twenty-four hours?" Dr.
Dibdin truly holds the thing to be impracticable,
because the book consisted of seven hundred and
seventy-eight folio pages. Such feats have been
done with the large capital and division of labour
of modern times; but to begin and finish such a
book in one day in the fifteenth century was certainly
an impossibility. We venture to think that
Caxton says nothing of the sort. He puts with
great force and justice the chief advantages of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">{87}</a></span>
printing,—the rapidity with which many copies
could be produced at once. He promised, he says,
to divers gentlemen and friends to address to them
as hastily as he might this book. There were
many who wanted the book. The transcribers
could not supply their wants. He could not multiply
copies himself with his pen, for his hand was
weary and his eyes dim. He learned, therefore, to
ordain the book in print, to the end that all his
friends might have the books at the same time,—that
every man might have them at once; and to
explain this, he says, all the books thus imprinted
were begun in one day. If he printed a hundred
copies, each of the hundred copies was begun at the
same time; a hundred sheets, each sheet forming
a portion of each copy, were printed off in one
day,—and in the same way were they also finished
in one day. He does not say, as Dr. Dibdin interprets
the passage, that <i>the book</i> was begun and
finished in one day,—one and the same day,—but
that <i>all</i> the books were begun on one day, and all
the books were finished on another day. His expression
is not very clear, but his meaning is quite
apparent. This was the end that he sought to
obtain at great charge and expense; this is the
end which has been more and more obtained at
every step forward in the art of printing,—the
rapid multiplication of copies, so that all men may
have them at once.</p>

<p>The place where Caxton learned the art of
printing, and the persons of whom he first learned
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">{88}</a></span>
it, are not shown in any of his voluminous prologues
and prefaces. But an extraordinary statement
was published in the year 1664, by a person
of the name of Richard Atkyns, who sought to
prove that printing was a royal prerogative, because,
as he says, the art was first brought into England
at the cost of the crown. His narrative is
held to be altogether a fiction; for the document
upon which he rests it was never forthcoming, and
no person has ever testified to the knowledge of it,
except Richard Atkyns himself, who laboured hard
to obtain a patent from the crown for the sole printing
of law-books, upon the ground which he attempts
to take of the crown having brought printing
into England. "Thomas Bourchier, Archbishop
of Canterbury, moved the then king, Henry VI., to
use all possible means for procuring a printing-mould,
for so it was then called, to be brought into
this kingdom. The king, a good man, and much
given to works of this nature, readily hearkened
to the motion; and taking private advice how to
effect this design, concluded it could not be brought
about without great secrecy, and a considerable
sum of money given to such person or persons as
would draw off some of the workmen from Haarlem
in Holland, where John Guttenberg had newly
invented it, and was himself personally at work.
It was resolved that less than one thousand marks
would not produce the desired effect: towards
which sum the said archbishop presented the king
with three hundred marks. The money being
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">{89}</a></span>
now prepared, the management of the design was
committed to Mr. Robert Turnour, who then was
keeper of the robes to the king, and a person most
in favour with him of any of his condition. Mr.
Turnour took to his assistance Mr. Caxton, a citizen
of good abilities, who, trading much into Holland,
might be a creditable pretence, as well for his
going as staying in the Low Countries. Mr. Turnour
was in disguise, his beard and hair shaven
quite off, but Mr. Caxton appeared known and public.
They having received the sum of one thousand
marks, went first to Amsterdam, then to Leyden,
not daring to enter Haarlem itself; for the town
was very jealous, having imprisoned and apprehended
divers persons, who came from other parts
for the same purpose. They stayed till they had
spent the whole one thousand marks in gifts and
expenses. So as the king was fain to send five
hundred marks more, Mr. Turnour having written
to the king that he had almost done his work, a
bargain, as he said, being struck between him and
two Hollanders for bringing off one of the workmen,
who should sufficiently discover and teach
the new art. At last, with much ado, they got off one
of the under workmen, whose name was Frederick
Corsells, or rather Corsellis; who late one night
stole from his fellows in disguise, into a vessel
prepared before for that purpose; and so the wind,
favouring the design, brought him safe to London.
It was not thought so prudent to set him on work
at London, but by the archbishop's means, who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">{90}</a></span>
had been Vice-chancellor and afterwards Chancellor
of the University of Oxon, Corsellis was carried
with a guard to Oxon, which constantly watched
to prevent Corsellis from any possible escape, till
he had made good his promise, in teaching how to
print. So that at Oxford printing was first set up
in England." This is certainly an extraordinary
story, and one which upon the face of it has traces
of inconsistency, if not of imposture. Richard
Atkyns says that a certain worthy person "did
present me with a copy of a record and manuscript
in Lambeth House, heretofore in his custody, belonging
to the See, and not to any particular Archbishop
of Canterbury. The substance whereof was
this; though I hope, for public satisfaction, the
record itself in its due time will appear." The record
itself did never appear, and, though diligently
sought for, could never be found. But Atkyns
further stated that the same most worthy person
who gave him the copy of the record, trusted him
with a book "printed at Oxon, <span class="smc lc">A.D.</span> 1468, which
was three years before any of the recited authors
[Stow and others] would allow it [printing] to be
in England." He does not mention the book; but
there is such a book, and it is entitled 'Expositio
Sancti Ieronimi in Simbolum, ad Papam Laurentiam;'
and at the end, 'Explicit Expositio, &amp;c., Impressa
Oxonie, et finita Anno Dom. <span class="smc lc">MCCCCLXVIII</span>,
xvii die Decembris.' Anthony Wood repeats the
story of Atkyns in his 'History of the University
of Oxford;' and he adds, "And thus the mystery
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">{91}</a></span>
of printing appeared ten years sooner in the University
of Oxford than at any other place in Europe,
Haarlem and Mentz excepted. Not long after there
were presses set up in Westminster, St. Albans,
Worcester, and other monasteries of note. After
this manner printing was introduced into England,
by the care of Archbishop Bourchier, in the year
of Christ 1464, and the third of King Edward IV."
Wood's version of the story makes it a little, a very
little, more credible, for it brings it nearer to the
time when the newly discovered art of printing
might have attracted some attention in England.
But even in 1464 there were, with scarcely more
than one exception, no printed books known in
Europe but the first productions of the press at
Mentz. The story of Caxton going to Haarlem in
the time of Henry the Sixth, that is, in some year
previous to 1461, must altogether be a fabrication,
or a mistake. The accounts that would ascribe
the invention of printing to Laurence Coster, of
Haarlem, set up a legendary story that John
Fust, or John Guttenberg (not the real Guttenberg,
but an elder brother), stole the invention
from Coster and carried it to Mentz in 1442. If
Caxton, therefore, went to Haarlem in Holland,
with a companion, in disguise, to learn the art of
printing, he must have gone there before 1442; for
the story holds that Coster was not only robbed of
his secret, but of his types, and gave up printing in
despair to his more fortunate spoiler. Bourchier
was not Archbishop of Canterbury till 1454. We
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">{92}</a></span>
may be sure, therefore, that, wherever Caxton went
to learn the art of printing at an earlier period than
is generally supposed, he did not go to Haarlem in
Holland. Substitute Mentz for Haarlem, and
Atkyns's story is more consistent. It is by no
means improbable that Henry the Sixth and Cardinal
Bourchier might have seen the magnificent
Latin bible, called the Mazarine bible, which was
printed by Guttenberg, Schoeffer, and Fust, and is
held to have appeared about 1455. Of this noble
book Mr. Hallam says, "It is a very striking circumstance,
that the high-minded inventors of this
great art tried at the very outset so bold a flight
as the printing an entire bible, and executed it
with astonishing success. It was Minerva leaping
on earth in her divine strength and radiant armour,
ready at the moment of her nativity to subdue and
destroy her enemies." The king and the archbishop
might have desired that England should
learn the art of executing so splendid a work as
the first bible. At that period we know that Caxton
was residing abroad, and he was a fit person to
be selected for such a commission. But kings at
that day were scarcely better supplied with money
than their subjects; and if Henry the Sixth had
sent to Mr. Robert Turnour or Mr. William Caxton
seven hundred marks at one time and five
hundred at another, the gifts must have been registered
with all due formality. We have the
Exchequer registers of Henry the Sixth and his
great rival; and although we learn that Edward
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">{93}</a></span>
the Fourth gave Caxton twenty pounds, neither his
name nor that of Mr. Tumour, nor even of the
archbishop, is associated with any bounty of Henry
the Sixth. We may, therefore, safely conclude,
with Dr. Conyers Middleton, with regard to all
this story, that "Mr. Atkyns, a bold vain man,
might be the inventor of it, having an interest in
imposing upon the world, to confirm his argument
that printing was of the prerogative royal, in opposition
to the stationers; against whom he was engaged
in expensive lawsuits, in defence of the king's
patents, under which he claimed some exclusive
powers of printing." The date of 1468 on the
Oxford book is reasonably concluded to have been
a typographical error. There are niceties in the
printing of that book which did not belong to the
earliest stages of the art; and the same type and
manner of printing are seen in Oxford books
printed immediately after 1478. The probability
therefore is, that an X was omitted in the Roman
numerals.</p>

<p>We could scarcely avoid detailing this story,
apocryphal as the whole matter is upon the face of
it, because the claims of Oxford to the honour of
the first printing-press were once the subject of a
fierce controversy. The honest antiquarian Oldys
complains most bitterly of Richard Atkyns, "How
unwarrantably he robbed Master Caxton of the
honour, wherewith he had long been, by the
suffrage of all learned men, undeniably invested,
of first introducing and practising this most scientifical
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">{94}</a></span>
invention among us." But had this story
been true, Caxton would not have been robbed of
his glory. He would still have been what Leland,
writing within half a century of his death, calls
him, "Angliæ Prototypographus"—the first printer
of England. For it is not the man who is the
accidental instrument of introducing a great invention,
and then pursues it no further, who is to have
the fame of its promulgation. It is he who by
patient and assiduous labour acquires the mastery
of a new principle, sees afar off the high objects to
which it may be applied, carries out its details
with persevering courage, is not deterred by failure
nor satisfied with partial success, works for a great
purpose through long years of anxiety, is careless
of honours or rewards, and finally does accomplish
all and much more than he proposed, planting the
tree, training it, rejoicing in its good fruit,—he it
is that is the real first introducer and practiser of a
great scientific invention, even though some one
may have preceded him in some similar attempt—an
experiment, but not a perfect work. We may
well believe that, for some ten years of his residence
abroad, the knowledge that a new art was discovered,
promising such mighty results as that of
printing, must have excited the deepest interest in
the mind of Caxton. He says himself, in his continuation
of the Polychronicon, "About this time
[1455] the craft of imprinting was first found in
Mogunce in Almayne." During his residence at
the court of Burgundy he would see the art multiplying
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">{95}</a></span>
around him. Italy, where it most extensively
flourished before 1470, was too distant for
his personal inspection. Bamberg, Augsburg, and
Strasburg brought it nearer to him. But Cologne,
where Conrad Winters set up a press about 1470,
was very near at hand. A few days' journey would
place him within the walls of the holy city of the
Rhine. Cologne, we have no doubt, fixed the employment
of the remainder of his life; and made
the London mercer, whose name, like the names
of many other good and respectable men, would
have held no place in the memory of the world
but for the art he learnt in his latter years,—Cologne
rendered the name of Caxton a bright and
venerable name;—a name that even his countrymen,
who are accustomed chiefly to raise columns
and statues to the warlike defenders of their country,
will one day honour amongst the heroes who
have most successfully cultivated the arts of peace,
and by high talent and patient labour have rendered
it impossible that mankind should not steadily
advance in the acquisition of knowledge and virtue,
and in the consequent amelioration of the lot of
every member of the family of mankind, at some
period, present or remote.</p>

<p>The provost of the city of Mentz, on the occasion
of the festival of Guttenberg, published an address
full of German enthusiasm, at which we may be
apt to smile, but which breathes a spirit of reverence
for the higher concerns of our being which
we might profitably engraft upon the practical
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">{96}</a></span>
good sense on which we pride ourselves. He says,
"If the mortal who invented that method of fixing
the fugitive sounds of words which we call the alphabet
has operated upon mankind like a divinity, so
also has Guttenberg's genius brought together the
once isolated inquirers, teachers, and learners—all
the scattered and divided efforts for extending
God's kingdom over the whole civilized earth—as
though beneath one temple. Guttenberg's invention,
not a lucky accident, but the golden fruit of a
well-considered idea—an invention made with a
perfect consciousness of its end—has above all
other causes, for more than four centuries, urged
forward and established the dominion of science;
and what is of the most importance, has immeasurably
advanced the mental formation and education
of the people. This invention, a true intellectual
sun, has mounted above the horizon, first of
the European Christians, and then of the people of
other climes and other faiths, to an ever-enduring
morning. It has made the return of barbarism,
the isolation of mankind, the reign of darkness,
impossible for all future times. It has established
a public opinion, a court of moral judicature common
to all civilized nations, whatever natural divisions
may separate them, as much as for the
provinces of one and the same state. In a word, it
has formed fellow labourers at the never-resting
loom of Christian European civilization in every
quarter of the world, in almost every island of the
ocean."</p>

<div class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">{97}</a></div>

<p>Filled with some such strong belief, although
perhaps a vague belief, of the blessings which printing
might bestow upon his own country, we may
view William Caxton proceeding, about the end
of 1470, to the city of Cologne, resolved to acquire
the art of which he had seen some of the effects,
without stint of labour or expense. That he was
an apt and diligent scholar his after works abundantly
prove.</p>

<p>The first book printed in the English language,
the 'Recueil of the Histories of Troy,' which we
have so often noticed, does not bear upon the face
of it when and where it was printed. That it was
printed by Caxton we can have no doubt, because
he says, "I have practised and learned, at my
great charge and dispense, to ordain this said book
in print." He tells us, too, in the title-page, that
the <i>translation</i> was finished at Cologne, in September,
1471. That Caxton printed at Cologne
we have tolerably clear evidence. There is a most
curious book of Natural History, originally written
in Latin by Bartholomew Glanvill, a Franciscan
friar of the fourteenth century, commonly known
as Bartholomæus. A translation of this book,
which is called 'De Proprietatibus Rerum,' was
printed in England by Wynkyn de Worde, who
was an assistant to Caxton in his printing-office at
Westminster, and there succeeded to him. In
some quaint stanzas which occur in this edition,
and which appear to be written either by or in the
name of the printer, are these lines, which we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">{98}</a></span>
copy, in the first instance, exactly following the
orthography and non-punctuation of the original:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">

<div class="verse quote2">"And also of your charyte call to remembraunce</div>
<div class="verse">The soule of William Caxton first prȳter of this boke</div>
<div class="verse">Jn laten tonge at Coleyn hȳself to auaūce</div>
<div class="verse">That euery well disposyd man may theron loke."</div>

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="nodent">That we are asked to call to remembrance the soul
of William Caxton is perfectly clear; but how are
we to read the subsequent members of the sentence?
The most obvious meaning appears to be that
William Caxton was the first printer of this book
in the Latin tongue; that he printed it at Cologne;
and that his object in printing it was to advance or
profit himself, in addition to his desire that every
well-disposed man might look upon it. But there
is another interpretation of these words, which is
certainly not a forced one;—that William Caxton
was the first printer of this book, the English
book, and that the object of his printing it was to
advance himself in the Latin tongue at Cologne.
"This book" would appear then to be, this English
book, this same book. If a copy of this book,
whether in Latin or English, printed at Cologne
at so early a period, could be found, the question
would be set at rest. There is a Latin edition
printed at Cologne, in 1481, by John Koelhoff;
and there is an edition in Latin without date or
place. The first English edition known is that by
Wynkyn de Worde, and that translation was made
much earlier than the time of Caxton, by John de
Trevisa. Caxton could scarcely have been said to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">{99}</a></span>
have desired to have advanced himself in the Latin
tongue, unless he had translated the book as well
as printed it. The mere fact of superintending
workmen who set up the types in Latin would have
done little to advance his knowledge of the language.
We believe, therefore, that we must receive
the obscure lines of Wynkyn de Worde as
evidence that Caxton did print at Cologne, and
that he undertook the Latin edition of Bartholomæus
as a commercial speculation, "himself to advance,"
or profit.</p>

<p>And, indeed, when we look at the state of England
after the return of Edward IV. from his exile,—the
"great divisions" of which Caxton himself
speaks,—we may consider that he acted with discretion
in conducting his first printing operations
in a German city. It must be also borne in mind
that this was by far the readiest mode to obtain a
competent knowledge in the new art. Had he
come over to England with types and presses, and
even with the most skilful workmen, the probability
is that the man of letters who, two or three years
before, had little or nothing to do in his attendance
upon the Burgundian court, would have ill succeeded
in so complicated and difficult a commercial
enterprise. Lambinet, a French bibliographical
writer, tells us that Melchior de Stamham, wishing
to establish a printing-office at Augsburg, engaged
a skilful workman of the same town, of the name of
Sauerloch. He employed a whole year in making
the necessary preparations for his office. He
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">{100}</a></span>
bought five presses, of the materials of which he
constructed five other presses. He cast pewter
types, and, having spent a large sum, seven hundred
and two florins, in establishing his office, began
working in 1473. He died before he had completed
one book; heartbroken, probably, at the
amount of capital he had sunk; for his unfinished
book was sold off at a mere trifle, and his office
broken up. This statement, which rests upon some
ancient testimony, shows us something of the difficulties
which had to be encountered by the early
printers. They had to do everything for themselves;
to construct the materials of their art,
types, presses, and every other instrument and appliance.
When Caxton began to print at Cologne,
he probably had the means of obtaining a set of
moulds from some previous printer,—what are
called strikes from the punches that form the original
matrices. The writers upon typography seem
to assume the necessity of every one of the old
printers cutting his punches anew, and shaping his
letters according to his own notions of proportionate
beauty. That the great masters of their
art, the first inventors, the Italian printers, the
Alduses, the Stephenses, pursued this course is perfectly
clear. But when printing ceased to be a
mystery, about 1462, it is more than probable that
those who tried to set up a press, especially in Germany,
either bought a few types of the more established
printers, or obtained a readier means of
casting types than that of cutting new punches,—a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">{101}</a></span>
difficult and expensive operation. Thus we believe
the attempts to assign a book without a
printer's name to some printer whose types that
book resembles, can be little relied upon. Caxton's
types are held to be like the type of this printer
and the type of that; and it is said that he copied
the types, with the objection added that he did not
copy the best models. What should have prevented
him buying the types from the continent,
as every English printer did until the middle of
the last century? or at any rate what should have
prevented him buying copies of the moulds which
other printers were using? The bas-relief upon
Thorwaldsen's statue of Guttenberg exhibits the
first printer examining a matrix. But all the difficulties
in the formation of the first matrix overcome,
we may readily see that, at every stage, the
art of making fusile types would become easier and
simpler, till at length the division of labour should
be perfectly applied to type-making, and the mere
casting of a letter, as each letter is cast singly, exhibit
one of the most rapid and beautiful pieces of
handiwork that the arts can show.</p>

<p>But the type obtained, Caxton would still have
much to do before his office was furnished. We
have seen how Melchior of Augsburg set about
getting his presses: "He bought of John Schuesseler
five presses, which cost him seventy-three
Rhenish florins: he constructed with these materials
five other smaller presses." To those who
know what a well-adjusted machine the commonest
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">{102}</a></span>
printing-press now in use is, it is not easy at first
to conceive what is meant by saying that Melchior
bought five presses, and made five other presses out
of the materials. The solution is this:—in all probability
this printer of Augsburg bought five old
wine-presses, and, using the screws, cut them down
and adapted them to the special purpose for which
he designed them. The earliest printing-press was
nothing more than a common screw-press,—such
as a cheese-press, or a napkin-press,—with a contrivance
for running the <i>form</i> of types under the
screw after the <i>form</i> was inked. It is evident that
this mode of obtaining an impression must have
been very laborious and very slow. As the screw
must have come down upon the types with a dead
pull,—that is, as the table upon which the types
were placed was solid and unyielding,—great care
must have been required to prevent the pressure
being so hard as to injure the face of the letters.</p>

<p>A famous printer, Jodocus Badius Ascensianus,
has exhibited his press in the title-page of a book
printed by him in 1498. Up to the middle of the
last century this rude press was in use in England;
although the press of an ingenious Dutch mechanic,
Blaew,—in which the pressure was rapidly communicated
from the screw to the types, and all the
parts of the press were yielding so as to produce a
sharp but not a crushing impression,—was gradually
superseding it. The early printers manufactured
their own ink, so that Caxton had to learn the art
of ink-making. The ink was applied to the types
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">{103}</a></span>
by balls, or dabbers, such as one of the men holds
who is working the press of Badius. Such dabbers
were universally used in printing forty years ago.
As the ancient weaver was expected to make his
own loom, so, even this short time since, the
division of labour was so imperfectly applied to
printing, that the pressman was expected to make
his own balls. A very rude and nasty process this
was. The sheepskins, called pelts, were prepared
in the printing-office, where the wool with which
they were stuffed was also carded; and these balls,
thus manufactured by a man whose general work
was entirely of a different nature, required the expenditure
of at least half an hour's labour every
day in a very disagreeable operation, by which they
were kept soft.</p>

<p>There were many other little niceties in the
home construction of the materials for printing
which Caxton would necessarily have to learn.
But in the earlier stages of an art requiring such
nice arrangement, both in the departments of the
compositor, or setter-up of the type, and of the
pressman, it is quite clear that many things which,
by the habit of four centuries, have become familiar
and easy in a printing-office, would be exceedingly
difficult to be acquired by the first printers. Rapidity
in the work was probably out of the question. Accidents
must constantly have occurred in wedging
up the single letters tightly in pages and sheets;
and when one looks at the regularity of the inking
of these old books, and the beautiful accuracy with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">{104}</a></span>
which the line on one side of a page falls on the
corresponding line on the other side (called by
printers "register"), we maybe sure that with very
imperfect mechanical means an amount of care was
taken in working off the sheets which would appear
ludicrous to a modern pressman. The higher
operation of a printing-office, which consists in
reading the proofs, must have been in the first
instance full of embarrassment and difficulty. A
scholar was doubtless employed to test the accuracy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">{105}</a></span>
of the proofs; probably some one who had been
previously employed to overlook the labours of the
transcribers. Fierce must have been the indignation
of such a one during a course of painful experience,
when he found one letter presented for
another, letters and even syllables and words
omitted, letters topsy-turvy, and even actual substitutions
of one word for another. These are almost
unavoidable consequences of the mechanical
operation of arranging moveable types, so entirely
different from the work of the transcriber. The
corrector of the press would not understand this;
and his life would not be a pleasant one. Caxton
was no doubt the corrector of his own press; and
well for him it was that he brought to his task the
patience, industry, and good temper which are
manifest in his writings.</p>

</div>

<p>But the ancient printer had something more to
do before his manufacture was complete. He was
a bookbinder as well as a printer. The ancient
books, manuscript as well as printed, were wonderful
specimens of patient labour. The board, literally
a wooden board, between which the leaves were
fastened, was as thick as the panel of a door. This
was covered with leather, sometimes embossed with
the most ingenious devices. There were large brass
nails, with ornamented heads, on the outside of
this cover, with magnificent corners to the lids. In
addition, there were clasps. The back was rendered
solid with paste and glue, so as to last for
centuries. Erasmus says of such a book, "As for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">{106}</a></span>
Thomas Aquinas's Secunda Secundæ, no man can
carry it about, much less get it into his head."
An ancient woodcut shows us the binder hammering
at the leaves to make them flat, and a lad sewing
the leaves in a frame very like that still in use.
Above are the books flying in the air in all their
solid glory.</p>

<p>But the most difficult labour of the ancient
printer, and that which would necessarily constitute
the great distinction between one printer and
another, was yet to come. He had to sell his
books when he had manufactured them, for there
was no division of the labour of publisher and
printer in those days. His success would of course
much depend upon the quality of his books; upon
their adaptation to the nature of the demand for
books; upon their accuracy; upon their approach
to the beauty of the old manuscripts. But he had
to incur the risk common to all copying processes,
whether the thing produced be a medal or a book,
of expending a large certain sum before a single
copy could be produced. The process of printing,
compared with that of writing, is a cheap process
as ordinarily conducted; but the condition of
cheapness is this,—that a sufficient number of
copies of any particular book may be reckoned
upon as saleable, so as to render the proportion of
the first expense upon a single copy inconsiderable.
If it were required even at the present time to
print a single copy, or even three or four copies
only, of any literary work, the cost of printing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">{107}</a></span>
would be greater than the cost of transcribing. It
is when hundreds, and especially thousands, of the
same work are demanded, that the great value of
the printing-press in making knowledge cheap is
particularly shown. It is probable that the first
printers did not take off more than two or three
hundred, if so many, of their works; and, therefore,
the earliest printed books must have been still
dear, on account of the limited number of their
readers. Caxton, as it appears by a passage in one
of his books, was a cautious printer; and required
something like an assurance that he should sell
enough of any particular book to repay the cost of
producing it. In his 'Legend of Saints' he says,
"I have submysed [submitted] myself to translate
into English the 'Legend of Saints,' called 'Legenda
aurea' in Latin; and William, Earl of
Arundel, desired me—and promised to take a reasonable
quantity of them—and sent me a worshipful
gentleman, promising that my said lord should
during my life give and grant to me a yearly fee,
that is to note, a buck in summer and a doe in
winter." Caxton, with his sale of a reasonable
quantity, and his summer and winter venison, was
more fortunate than others of his brethren, who
speculated upon a public demand for books without
any guarantee from the great and wealthy.
Sweynheim and Pannartz, Germans who settled in
Rome, and there printed many beautiful editions
of the Latin Classics, presented a petition to the
Pope, in 1471, which contains the following passage:—"We
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">{108}</a></span>
were the first of the Germans who
introduced this art, with vast labour and cost, into
your holiness' territories, in the time of your predecessor;
and encouraged by our example other
printers to do the same. If you peruse the catalogue
of the works printed by us, you will admire
how and where we could procure a sufficient quantity
of paper, or even rags, for such a number of
volumes. The total of these books amounts to
12,475,—a prodigious heap,—and intolerable to
us, your holiness' printers, by reason of those unsold.
We are no longer able to bear the great
expense of housekeeping, for want of buyers; of
which there cannot be a more flagrant proof than
that our house, though otherwise spacious enough,
is full of quire-books, but void of every necessary
of life." For some years after the invention of
printing, many of the ingenious, learned, and enterprising
men who devoted themselves to the new
art which was to change the face of society, were
ruined, because they could not sell cheaply unless
they printed considerable number of a book; and
there were not readers enough to take off the stock
which they thus accumulated. In time, however,
as the facilities for acquiring knowledge which
printing afforded created many readers, the trade
of printing books became one of less general risk;
and dealers in literature could afford more and
more to dispense with individual patronage, and
rely upon the public demand.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VI.</h3>

<p class="gist">The Press at Westminster—Theological Books—Character of
Caxton's Press—The Troy Book—The Game of the Chess.</p>

<p class="nodent"><span class="smc">The</span> indications of the period at which Caxton
first brought the art of printing into England are
not very exact. Several of his books, supposed to
have been amongst the earliest, are without date or
place of impression. The first in the title of which
a date or a place is mentioned is 'The Dictes and
Sayinges of Philosophres,' translated by the Earl
of Rivers from the French. This bears upon the
title "Enprynted by me William Caxton, at
Westminster, the yere of our Lord <span class="smc lc">M.CCCC.</span> lxxvij."
Another imprint, three years later, is more precise.
It is in the 'Chronicles of Englond,' which book
the printer says was "Enprynted by me, William
Caxton, in thabbey of Westmynstre by london, &amp;c.,
the v day of Juyn, the yere of thincarnacion of our
lord god <span class="smc lc">M.CCCC.</span> lxxx." In 1485, 'A Book of the
Noble Hystoryes of Kynge Arthur,' was "by me
deuyded into xxi bookes chapytred and enprynted
and fynysshed, in thabbey Westmestre." The
expression "in the Abbey of Westminster" leaves
no doubt that beneath the actual roof of some
portion of the abbey Caxton carried on his art.
Stow, in his 'Survey of London,' says, "In the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">{110}</a></span>
Eleemosynary or Almonry at Westminster Abbey,
now corruptly called the Ambry, for that the
alms of the abbey were there distributed to the
poor, John Islip, Abbot of Westminster, erected
the first press of book-printing that ever was in
England, and Caxton was the first that practised
it in the said abbey." The careful historian of
London here committed one error; John Islip did
not become Abbot of Westminster till 1500.
John Esteney was made abbot in 1474, and
remained such until his death in 1498. His predecessor
was Thomas Milling. In Dugdale's 'Monasticon'
we find, speaking of Esteney, "It was
in this abbot's time, and not in that of Milling, or
in that of Abbot Islip, that Caxton exercised the
art of printing at Westminster. He is said to
have erected his office in one of the side chapels of
the abbey, supposed by some of our historians to
have been the Ambry or Eleemosynary." Oldys
says, "Whoever authorized Caxton, it is certain
that he did there, at the entrance of the abbey, exercise
the art, from whence a printing-room is to
this day called a chapel." When we consider the
large extent of building that formed a portion of
the abbey of Westminster, before the house was
shorn of its splendour by Henry the Eighth, we
may readily believe that Caxton might have been
accommodated in a less sacred and indeed less
public place than a side chapel of the present
church. There were buildings attached to that
church which were removed to make room for the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">{111}</a></span>
Chapel of Henry the Seventh. It has been conjectured
that the ancient Scriptorium of the Abbey,
the place where books were transcribed, might
have been assigned to Caxton, to carry on an art
which was fast superseding that of the transcriber.
Nor are there wanting other examples of the encouragement
afforded to printing by great religious
societies. As early as 1480, books were printed at
St. Alban's; and in 1525 there was a translation
of Boetius printed in the monastery of Tavistock,
by Dan Thomas Richards, monk of the same monastery.
That the intercourse of Caxton with the
Abbot of Westminster was on a familiar footing
we learn from his own statement, in 1490: "My
Lord Abbot of Westminster did shew to me late
certain evidences written in Old English, for to
reduce it into our English now used."</p>

<p>Setting up his press in this sacred place, it is
somewhat remarkable how few of Caxton's books
are distinctly of a religious character.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_12" id="Ref_12" href="#Foot_12">[12]</a></span>
Not more than five or six can be held strictly to pertain to
theological subjects. Bibles he could not print, as
we shall presently notice.</p>

<p>There is no breviary or book of prayers found to
have issued from his press. The only book distinctly
connected with the Church is 'Liber Festivalis,'
or Directions for keeping Feasts all the year.
It is highly probable that many of such books
have perished. But what furnishes a curious example
of the accidents by which the smallest things
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">{112}</a></span>
may be preserved, there is now existing, preserved
in Mr. Douce's collection in the Bodleian Library
at Oxford, a handbill, precisely such as a publisher
of the present day might distribute, printed in
Caxton's largest type, inviting the people to come
to his office and buy a certain book regulating the
church service. "If it plese any man spirituel or
temporel to bye ony Pyes of two and thre comemoracions
of Salisburi vse enprynted after the
forme of this present lettre whiche ben wel and
truly correct, late hym come to Westmonester into
the Almonesrye at the reed pale and he shal have
them good chepe. Supplico stet cedula." The
preface to the present Liturgy of the Church of
England explains what a Pye was: "The number
and hardness of the rules called the Pie, and the
manifold changings of the service, was the cause,
that to turn the book only was so hard and intricate
a matter, that many times there was more
business to find out what should be read, than to
read it when it was found out." It is a curious
fact that printers even at the present day call a
confused heap of types Pie; and whilst no one has
attempted to explain the origin of the word, we
may venture to suggest that the intricacy of this
Romish ordinal might lead the printers to call a
mass of confused and deranged letters by a familiar
expression of contempt derived from the Pie which
they or their predecessors in the art had been accustomed
to work upon.</p>

<p>Sir Thomas More has clearly shown the reason
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">{113}</a></span>
why Caxton could not venture to print a Bible,
although the people would have greedily bought
Wickliff's translation. There were translations of
the Bible before Wickliff, and that translation
which goes by the name of this great reformer was
probably made up in some degree from those previous
translations. Wickliff's translation was interdicted,
and thus More says, "On account of the
penalties ordered by Archbishop Arundel's constitution,
though the old translations that were before
Wickliff's days remained lawful and were in some
folks' hands had and read, yet he thought no printer
would lightly be so hot to put any bible in print at
his own charge—and then hang upon a doubtful
trial whether the first copy of his translation was
made before Wickliff's days or since. For if it
were made since, it must be approved before the
printing." This was a dilemma that Caxton would
have been too prudent to encounter.</p>

<p>In the books printed by Caxton which treat of
secular subjects, there is constant evidence of the
sincere and unpretending piety of this skilful and
laborious author and artisan. He lived in an age
when the ancient power of the church was somewhat
waning; and far-sighted observers saw the
cloud no bigger than a man's hand which indicated
the approaching storm. One of his biographers,
the Rev. Mr. Lewis, says of him that "he expressed
a great sense of religion, and wrote like one who
lived in the fear of God, and was very desirous of
promoting his honour and glory." It was in this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">{114}</a></span>
spirit that he desired the religious teaching of the
people not to be formal and pedantic. The Preface
to '<i>The Doctrinal of Sapyence</i>,' which was translated
out of French into English by Caxton, contains
a curious passage:—"This that is written in
this little book ought the priests to learn and teach
to their parishes: and also it is necessary for simple
priests that understand not the Scriptures: and
it is made for simple people and put in English.
And by cause that for to hear examples stirreth and
moveth the people, that ben simple, more to devotion
than to that great authority of science—as it
appeareth by the right reverend father and doctor
Bede, priest, which saith, in the Histories of
England, that a bishop of Scotland, a subtle and
a great clerk, was sent by the clerks of Scotland
into England for to preach the Word of God; but
by cause he used in his sermon subtle authorities,
such as [for] simple people had, nor took, no savour,
he returned without doing of any great good ne profit,
wherefore they sent another of less science: the
which was more plain, and used commonly in his
sermons examples and parables, by which he profited
much more unto the erudition of the simple
people than did that other."</p>

<p>But, in wishing the highest knowledge to be simplified
and made popular, the good old printer had
no thought of rendering knowledge a light and
frivolous thing, to be taken up and laid down
without earnestness. In his truly beautiful exposition
of the uses of knowledge, contained in his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">{115}</a></span>
prologue to the 'Mirror of the World,' he says,
"Let us pray the Maker and Creator of all creatures,
God Almighty, that, at the beginning of this
book, it list him, of his most bounteous grace, to
depart with us of the same that we may learn; and
that learned, to retain; and that retained, to
teach; that we may have so perfect science and
knowledge of God, that we may get thereby the
health of our souls, and to be partners of his
glory, permanent, and without end, in heaven.
Amen."</p>

<p>Gibbon, we think, has taken a somewhat severe
view of the character of the works which were produced
by the father of English printing:—"It was
in the year 1474 that our first press was established
in Westminster Abbey, by William Caxton: but
in the choice of his authors, that liberal and industrious
artist was reduced to comply with the vicious
taste of his readers; to gratify the nobles with
treatises on heraldry, hawking, and the game of
chess, and to amuse the popular credulity with
romances of fabulous knights and legends of more
fabulous saints." The historian, however, notices
with approbation the laudable desire which Caxton
expresses to elucidate the history of his country.
But his censure of the general character of the
works of Caxton's press is somewhat too sweeping.
It appears to us that a more just as well as a more
liberal view of the use and tendency of these works
is that of Thomas Warton, which we may be excused
in quoting somewhat at length:—"By means
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">{116}</a></span>
of French translations, our countrymen, who understood
French much better than Latin, became acquainted
with many useful books which they would
not otherwise have known. With such assistances,
a commodious access to the classics was opened,
and the knowledge of ancient literature facilitated
and familiarised in England, at a much earlier
period than is imagined; and at a time when little
more than the productions of speculative monks
and irrefragable doctors could be obtained or were
studied.... When these authors, therefore,
appeared in a language almost as intelligible as the
English, they fell into the hands of illiterate and
common readers, and contributed to sow the seeds
of a national erudition, and to form a popular taste.
Even the French versions of the religious, philosophical,
historical, and allegorical compositions of
those more enlightened Latin writers who flourished
in the middle ages, had their use, till better books
came into vogue: pregnant as they were with
absurdities, they communicated instruction on various
and new subjects, enlarged the field of information,
and promoted the love of reading, by
gratifying that growing literary curiosity which
now began to want materials for the exercise of its
operations.... These French versions enabled
Caxton, our first printer, to enrich the state
of letters in this country with many valuable publications.
He found it no difficult task, either by
himself or the help of his friends, to turn a considerable
number of these pieces into English,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">{117}</a></span>
which he printed. Ancient learning had as yet
made too little progress among us to encourage
this enterprising and industrious artist to publish
the Roman authors in their original language: and
had not the French furnished him with these materials,
it is not likely that Virgil, Ovid, Cicero, and
many other good writers would by the means of
his press have been circulated in the English
tongue so early as the close of the fifteenth century."
Warton adds in a note, "It was a circumstance
favourable at least to English literature,
owing indeed to the general illiteracy of the times,
that our first printers were so little employed on
books written in the learned languages. Almost
all Caxton's books are English. The multiplication
of English copies multiplied English readers, and
these again produced new vernacular writers. The
existence of a press induced many persons to turn
authors who were only qualified to write in their
native tongue." Having thus given the somewhat
different views of two most able and accomplished
scholars, viewing as they did the same objects
through different media, we shall proceed to notice
some of the more remarkable characteristics of the
books issued from Caxton's press, rather regarding
them as illustrations of the state of knowledge and
the manners of his time, than as mere bibliographical
curiosities.</p>

<p><i>The Histories of Troy</i> is a book with which our
readers must now be tolerably familiar. A writer
in the century succeeding Caxton, one Robert
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">{118}</a></span>
Braham, is very severe upon the old printer for
this his work: "If a man studious of that history
[the Trojan war] should seek to find the same in
the doings of William Caxton, in his lewd [idle]
'Recueil of Troye,' what should he then find, think
ye? Assuredly none other thing but a long, tedious,
and brainless babbling, tending to no end,
nor having any certain beginning; but proceeding
therein as an idiot in his folly, that cannot make
an end till he be bidden. Much like the foolish
and unsavoury doings of Orestes, whom Juvenal
remembereth—which Caxton's 'Recueil,' who so
list with judgment peruse, shall rather think his
doings worthy to be numbered amongst the trifling
tales and barren lewderies of Robin Hood and
Bevis of Hampton, than remain as a monument of
so worthy an history." We have no sympathy
with writers, old or modern, who are severe upon
"trifling tales and barren lewderies"—the stories
and ballads which are the charm of childhood and
the solace of age. It is somewhat hard that Caxton
should be thus maltreated for having made the
English familiar with that romance of the Trojan
war with which all Europe was enamoured in some
language or another. The authority which Le
Fevre partly followed was the Troy Book of Guido
di Colonna; and he is traced to have translated
his book from a Norman-French poet of the time
of Edward the Second; and the Norman is to be
traced to Dares Phrygius and Dictys Cretensis, the
supposed authors of two ancient works on the History
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">{119}</a></span>
of Troy, but which histories are held to have
been manufactured by an Englishman of the twelfth
century. Guido di Colonna constructed the most
captivating of the romances of chivalry upon these
supposititious tales of Troy. Hector and Achilles
are surrounded by him with all the attributes of
knight-errantry; and the Grecian manners are
Gothicised with all the peculiarities of the civilization
of the middle ages. Lydgate constructed upon
this romance his poem of the Troy Book; and
Chaucer availed himself of it in his poem of
'Troilus and Cressida.' Shakspere, in his wonderful
play upon the same part of the Trojan story
of the middle ages, has used Chaucer, Lydgate, and
Caxton; and several passages show that our great
dramatic poet was perfectly familiar with the
translation of our old printer, which was so popular
that by Shakspere's time it had passed through
six editions, and continued to be read even in the
last century.</p>

<p>'<i>The Book of the whole Life of Jason</i>,' printed
by Caxton in 1475, is another of these middle-age
romances, founded upon the supposititious histories
of Dares and Dictys.</p>

<p>Of '<i>The Game and Play of the Chess</i>' Caxton
printed two editions, which he translated himself
from the French. The first was finished on the
last day of March, 1474; and it is supposed to
have been the first book which he printed in England.
Bagford says, "Caxton's first book in the
Abbey was 'The Game of Chess;' a book in those
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">{120}</a></span>
times much in use with all sorts of people, and in
all likelihood first desired by the abbot, and the
rest of his friends and masters." It was a book that
Caxton clearly intended for the diffusion of knowledge
amongst all ranks of people; for in his second
edition he says, in not very complimentary phrase,
"The noble clerks have written and compiled many
notable works and histories," that they might come
"to the knowledge and understanding of such as
be ignorant, of which the number is infinite." And
he adds, with still plainer speech, that, according
to Solomon, "the number of fools is infinite." He
says that amongst these noble clerks there was
an excellent doctor of divinity in the kingdom of
France, which "hath made a book of the chess
moralised, which at such a time as I was resident
in Bruges came into my hands."</p>

<p>It would seem to be an ingenious device of the
reverend writer of the book of chess which Caxton
translated, to associate with very correct instructions
as to the mode of playing the game, such moralisations
as would enable him therewith to teach the
people "to understand wisdom and virtue." Caxton
readily adopts the same notion. He dedicates the
book to the Duke of Clarence: "Forasmuch as I
have understood and known that you are inclined
unto the commonweal of the king, our said sovereign
lord, his nobles, lords, and common people of his
noble realm of England, and that ye saw gladly the
inhabitants of the same informed in good, virtuous,
profitable, and honest manners." This book contains
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">{121}</a></span>
authorities, sayings, and stories, "applied
unto the morality of the public weal, as well of the
nobles and of the common people, after the game
and play of chess;" and Caxton trusts that "other,
of what estate or degree he or they stand in, may
see in this little book that they govern themselves
as they ought to do." This book of chess contains
four treatises. The first describes the invention of
the game in the time of a king of Babylon, Emsmerodach,
a cruel king, the son of Nebuchadnezzar,
to whom a philosopher showed the game for the
purpose of exhibiting "the manners and condition
of a king, of the nobles, and of the common people
and their offices, and how they should be touched
and drawn, and how he should amend himself and
become virtuous." This is a bold fable, and takes
us farther back than Sir William Jones, who says
that chess was imported from the west of India, in
the sixth century, and known immemorially in
Hindustan by the name of Chaturanga, or the four
members of an army, namely, elephants, horses,
chariots, and foot-soldiers. The second treatise in
Caxton's book describes, first, the office of a king:
by this name the principal piece was always known.
Secondly, of the queen; this name would seem to
belong to the time of Caxton, for Chaucer and Lydgate
call the piece Fers or Feers, a noble, a general,—hence
Peer. Thirdly, of the Alphyns: this is
the same as the present bishop; the French called
this personage the Fou, and Rabelais calls him the
Archer. Fourthly, the knight, who was always
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">{122}</a></span>
called by this name, in English and French chess.
The rook, the fifth dignified piece, is from the
Eastern name Ruc. Caxton goes on to inform us
that the third treatise is of the offices of the common
people. This treatise relates to the pawns;
and a curious thing it is that the eight pawns of
the board are taken by him each to represent large
classes of the commonalty. The denominations of
these classes somewhat vary in the two editions, but
their general arrangement is the same. We have,
in the first class, labourers and tillers of the earth;
in the second, smiths and other workers in iron and
metal; in the third, notaries, advocates, scriveners,
drapers, and makers of cloth; in the fourth, merchants
and changers; in the fifth, physicians, leeches,
spicers, and apothecaries; in the sixth, taverners,
hostelers, and victuallers; in the seventh, guards of
the cities, receivers of custom, and tollers; and
lastly, messengers, couriers, ribalds, and players at
the dice.</p>

<p>The second edition of 'The Game of the Chess,'
which is without date or place, was the first book
printed in the English language which contained
woodcuts. We give a fac-simile of the figure of the
knight in Caxton's volume.</p>

<div class="image-center">
  <img src="images/knight.jpg" width="400" height="354" alt="knight" />
</div>

<p>The original art of engraving on wood, and
the production of block-books, gradually merged,
as we have seen, into the art of printing from
moveable types. From that time woodcuts
became a secondary part of books, used, indeed,
very often by the early printers, but by no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">{123}</a></span>
means forming an indispensable branch of typography.
Imitating the manuscript books, the first
printers chiefly employed the wood-engraver upon
initial letters; and sometimes the pages of their
works were surrounded by borders, which contained
white lines or sprigs of foliage upon a black ground.
If a figure, or group of figures, was introduced, little
more than the outline was first attempted. By degrees,
however, endeavours were made to represent
gradations of shadow; and a few light hatchings,
or white dots, were employed. All cross-hatchings,
such as characterize a line-engraving upon metal,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">{124}</a></span>
were carefully avoided by the early woodcutters, on
account of the difficulty in the process. Mr. Ottley,
in his 'History of Engraving,' says that an engraver
on wood, of the name of Wohlgemuth (who
flourished at Nuremburg about 1480), "perceived
that, though difficult, this was not impossible;"
and, in the cuts of the 'Nuremburg Chronicle,'
a "successful attempt was first made to
imitate the bold hatchings of a pen-drawing."
Albert Durer, an artist of extraordinary talent, became
the pupil of Wohlgemuth; and by him, and
many others, wood-engraving was carried to a perfection
which it subsequently lost till its revival in
our own country.</p>

<p class="nodent"><span class="smc">In</span> the library belonging to the Archbishops of Canterbury,
at Lambeth, is a beautiful manuscript, on
vellum, of a French work, 'Les Dicts Moraux des
Philosophes,' which contains the illumination of
which the above is a copy. In lines written under
the illumination the book is stated to be translated
by "Antony erle," by which Lord Rivers is meant.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">{126}</a></span>
This book was printed by Caxton in 1477; and it
is held that the man kneeling by the side of the
earl in the illumination is the printer of the book.
We have already mentioned the confidential intercourse
which subsisted between Lord Rivers and
his printer, with regard to the revision of this work.
(See page 82.) The passages which we there quote
are given in a sort of appendix, in which Caxton.
professes to have himself translated a chapter upon
women, which Lord Rivers did not think fit to
meddle with, and which he prints with a real or
affected apprehension. The printer's statement is
altogether such a piece of sly humour, that we
willingly transcribe it, trusting that our readers
will see the drollery through the quaintness:—</p>

<p>"I find that my said lord hath left out certain
and divers conclusions touching women. Whereof
I marvelled that my said lord hath not writ on
them, nor what hath moved him so to do, nor what
cause he had at that time. But I suppose that
some fair lady hath desired him to leave it out of
his book; or else he was amorous on some noble
lady, for whose love he would not set it in his
book; or else for the very affection, love, and good
will that he hath unto all ladies and gentlewomen,
he thought that Socrates spared the sooth, and
wrote of women more than truth; which I cannot
think that so true a man and so noble a philosopher
as Socrates was, should write otherwise than truth.
For if he had made fault in writing of women, he
ought not nor should not be believed in his other
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">{127}</a></span>
Dictes and Sayings. But I perceive that my said
lord knoweth verily that such defaults be not had
nor found in the women born and dwelling in these
parts nor regions of the world. Socrates was a
Greek, born in a far country from hence, which
country is all of other conditions than this is, and
men and women of other nature than they be here
in this country; for I wot well, of whatsoever condition
women be in Greece, the women of this
country be right good, wise, pleasant, humble, discreet,
sober, chaste, obedient to their husbands,
true, secret, stedfast, ever busy, and never idle,
attemperate in speaking, and virtuous in all their
works; or at least should be so. For which causes
so evident, my said lord, as I suppose, thought it
was not of necessity to set in his book the sayings
of his author Socrates touching women."</p>

<p>There is a book translated by Caxton from the
French, and printed by him in 1484, which we
may incidentally here notice, as illustrating the
female manners of that century. It is called '<i>The
Knight of the Tower</i>;' and really would seem to
justify the sarcasm of Caxton where he says, "The
women of this country be right good, &amp;c., or at
least should be so." The preface implies that the
work, though written by a Frenchman, applies to
the contemporary state of society in England; and
it may be well to see how our ladies were employed
about four centuries ago. It appears from this
curious performance that the ladies, although well
accomplished in needlework, confectionary, church
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">{128}</a></span>
music, and even taught something of the rude surgery
of those days, were not great proficients in
reading, and the art of writing was thought to be
better let alone by them. The Knight of the Tower
complains of the levity of the ladies. Their extravagance
in dress, the husband's standing complaint,
is thus put by the Knight of the Tower: "The
wives say to their husbands every day, 'Sir, such a
wife and such hath such goodly array that beseemeth
her well, and I pray you I may have of
the same.' And if her husband say, 'Wife, if such
have such array, such that are wiser than they have
it not,' she will say, 'No force it is [that is of no
consequence], for they cannot wear it; and if I have
it, ye shall see how well it will become me, for I
can wear it.' And thus with her words her husband
must needs ordain her that which she desireth,
or he shall never have peace with her, for
they will find so many reasons that they will not
be warned [put off]." The women of lower estate
come in for the same censure, the complaint being
that they <i>fur</i> their draperies and <i>fur</i> their heels.
It appears to have been the practice for ladies to
go very freely to feasts and assemblies, to joustings
and tournaments, without what we now call the
protection of a husband or a male relation. A contemporary
writer says, they lavished their wealth
and corrupted their virtue by these freedoms. If
we may judge from the warnings which the Knight
of the Tower gives his daughters of the discipline
they would receive at the hands of their husbands
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">{129}</a></span>
for any act of disobedience,—the discipline not only
of hard words, but of harder blows,—it is not to
be wondered at that they sought abroad for some
relief to the gloom and severity of their home lives.
It is pleasant, amidst these illustrations of barbarous
and profligate manners, to find a picture of that
real goodness which has distinguished the female
character in all ages, and which, especially in the
times of feudal oppression of which we are speaking,
mitigated the lot of those who were dependent
upon the benevolence of the great possessors of
property. The good Lady Cecile of Balleville is
thus described by the Knight of the Tower: "Her
daily ordinance was, that she rose early enough,
and had ever friars and two or three chaplains,
which said matins before her within the oratory.
And after, she heard a high mass and two low, and
said her service full devoutly. And after this she
went and arrayed herself, and walked in her garden
or else about her place, saying her other devotions
and prayers. And as time was she went to dinner.
And after dinner, if she wist and knew any sick
folk or women in their childbed, she went to see
and visited them, and made to be brought to them
her best meat. And there as she might not go
herself, she had a servant proper therefore, which
rode upon a little horse, and bare with him great
plenty of good meat and drink, for to give to the
poor and sick folk there as they were. Also, she
was of such custom, that, if she knew any poor gentlewoman
that should be wedded, she arrayed her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">{130}</a></span>
with her jewels. Also she went to the obsequies
of poor gentlewomen, and gave there torches, and
such other luminary as it needed thereto. And
after she had heard evensong she went to her supper
if she fasted not, and timely she went to bed,
and made her steward to come to her to wit [know]
what meat should be had the next day. She made
great abstinence, and wore the hair upon the
Wednesday and upon the Friday." This is a true
character of the middle ages;—goodness based
upon sincere piety, but that degenerating into
penances and mortifications, which our Reformed
faith teaches us to believe are unnecessary for
spiritual elevation.</p>

<p>Caxton's early friend and patron, Lord Rivers,
appears, as far as we can judge from the books
which remain, to have been the only one of the
first English printer's contemporaries who rendered
him any literary assistance. He contributed three
works to Caxton's press; namely, the 'Dictes and
Sayings of the Philosophers,' 'The Moral Proverbs
of Christine de Pisa,' and the book named 'Cordial.'</p>

<p>The book named '<i>Cordial</i>' is clearly described
in a prologue by Caxton. It was delivered to him,
he says, by Lord Rivers, "for to be imprinted and
so multiplied to go abroad among the people, that
thereby more surely might be remembered the four
last things undoubtedly coming." Caxton, in an
elaborate commendation of his patron, of whose
former "great tribulation and adversity" he speaks,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">{131}</a></span>
says, "It seemeth that he conceiveth well the mutability
and the unstableness of this present life,
and that he desireth, with a great zeal and spiritual
love, our ghostly help and perpetual salvation."
Lord Rivers had indeed borne tribulation since the
time when, the flower of Edward's court, he jousted
with the Bastard of Burgundy in Smithfield, in
1468. In the following year his father and brother
were murdered by a desperate faction at Northampton.
When Lord Rivers, conceiving the mutability
and unstableness of life, wrote the book
called 'Cordial,' he was only six-and-thirty years
of age. Three years after Caxton printed the
book, the translator was himself murdered at Pomfret
by the Protector Richard. Shakspere did not
do injustice to the noble character of this peer when
he makes him exclaim, when he was led to the block,</p>

<p>There is left to us a remarkable fragment which
indicates to us something higher than the ability
and literary attainment of this unfortunate nobleman.
It has been preserved by John Rouse, a contemporary
historian, who lived in the pleasant solitude
of Guy's Cliff, near Warwick, and died there
in 1491. He says (we translate from his Latin),
"In the time of his imprisonment at Pomfret he
wrote a balet in English, which has been shown to
me, having these words—Sum what musyng," &amp;c.;
and then Rouse transcribes the ballad, of which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">{132}</a></span>
the second stanza is imperfect, but has been supplied
from another ancient copy. Percy, who
prints the ballad in his 'Reliques,' says, "If we
consider that it was written during his cruel confinement
in Pomfret Castle, a short time before his
execution in 1483, it gives us a fine picture of the
composure and steadiness with which this stout
earl beheld his approaching fate." We subjoin the
ballad, modernising the orthography:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<p>Turn we to one of the more important works of
Caxton, in which he sought to inform his countrymen
generally with a knowledge of history. '<i>The
Chronicles of England</i>,' printed in 1480, begins
at the fabulous period before the Romans, and ends
at the commencement of the reign of Edward IV.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">{133}</a></span>
The early legends of English History, which even
Milton did not disdain to touch upon, are founded
upon the 'History' of Nennius, which was composed
in the ninth century, and which was copied
by Geoffrey of Monmouth and other of the early
chroniclers. Caxton took the thing as he found
it, and continued the narrative to his own time.
He deals prudently with contemporary events.
Caxton followed up these chronicles in the same
year with another book, called '<i>The Description
of Britain</i>,' in which he tells of the extent of
the island, its marvels and wonders, its highways,
rivers, cities, and towns, provinces, laws, bishoprics,
and languages. He describes also Scotland and
Ireland. Some of his marvels and wonders are a
little astounding; but others are as precise in their
description, and as forcible (brevity being an essential
quality), as we could well desire. Thus of
Stonehenge: "At Stonehinge beside Salisbury
there be great stones and wondrous huge; and be
reared on high, as it were gates set upon other
gates; nevertheless it is not known cleanly nor
aperceived how and wherefore they be so areared
and so wonderful hanged."</p>

<p>From the chronicles of his own country Caxton
sought to lead his readers forward to a knowledge
of the history of other countries. He published in
1482 '<i>The Polychronicon</i>, containing the bearings
and deeds of many times.' This book was originally
composed by Higden, a Benedictine monk of
Chester; and was translated from Latin into English
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">{134}</a></span>
by John de Trevisa, who lived in the times of
Edward III. and Richard II. Caxton in his title-page,
says, "Imprinted by William Caxton, after
having somewhat changed the rude and old English,
that is to wit certain words which in these days be
neither used nor understanden." In another place
he says, "And now at this time simply imprinted
and set in form by me, William Caxton, and a
little embellished from the old making." Caxton
was here doing what every person who desires to
advance the knowledge of his time, by extending
that knowledge beyond the narrow circle of scholars
and antiquarians, must always do. He popularised
an old book; he made it intelligible. He did not
do,—as some verbal pedants amongst us still persist
in doing,—present our old writers, and especially
our poets, in all the capriciousness of their
original orthography. He was the first great
diffuser of knowledge amongst us; and surely we
think he took a judicious course. He says of the
'Polychronicon,' "The book is general, touching
shortly many notable matters." But, <i>general</i> as
the book was, and extensively as he desired to
circulate it according to his limited means, he does
not approach his task without a due sense of the
importance of the knowledge he was seeking to
impart. The praise of history in his proem is truly
eloquent: "History is a perpetual conservatrice of
those things that have been before this present
time; and also a quotidian witness of benefits, of
malfaits [evil deeds], great acts, and triumphal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">{135}</a></span>
victories of all manner of people. And also, if the
terrible feigned fables of poets have much stirred
and moved men to right and conserving of justice,
how much more is to be supposed that history,
assertrice of virtue and a mother of all philosophy,
moving our manners to virtue, reformeth and reconcileth
near hand all those men which through the
infirmity of our moral nature hath led the most
part of their life in otiosity [idleness], and misspended
their time, passed right soon out of remembrance:
of which life and death is equal
oblivion." Again, "Other monuments distributed
in divers changes endure but for a short time or
season; but the virtue of history, diffused and
spread by the universal world hath time, which
consumeth all other things, as conservatrice and
keeper of her work."</p>

<p>'<i>The Image or Mirror of the World</i>' is one of
the popular books which Caxton translated from
the French. It treats of a vast variety of subjects,
after the imperfect natural philosophy of those days.
We have an account of the seven liberal arts; of
nature, how she worketh; and how the earth holdeth
him right in the middle of the world. We
have also much geographical information, amongst
which the wonders of Inde occupy a considerable
space. Meteorology and astronomy take up another
large portion. The work concludes with an account
of the celestial paradise. This book seems specially
addressed to high and courtly readers, for Caxton
says, "The hearts of nobles, in eschewing of idleness
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">{136}</a></span>
at such time as they have none other virtuous
occupations on hand, ought to exercise them in
reading, studying, and visiting the noble feats and
deeds of the sage and wise men, sometime travelling
in profitable virtues; of whom it happeneth
oft that some be inclined to visit the books treating
of sciences particular; and other to read and visit
books speaking of feats of arms, of love, or of other
marvellous histories; and among all other, this
present book, which is called the 'Image or Mirror
of the World,' ought to be visited, read, and
known, by cause it treateth of the world, and of
the wonderful division thereof." But the translator
tells us, "I have endeavoured me therein, at the
request and desire, cost and dispense, of the honourable
and worshipful man, Hugh Brice, citizen and
alderman of London." We may therefore believe
that Caxton intended this book for a wider circulation
than that of the nobles whom he addresses;
especially as he says, "I have made it so plain
that every man reasonable may understand it, if he
advisedly and attentively read it, or hear it." The
good old printer rendered the book intelligible to
all classes, under the condition that all who read it
should give their attention. This is one of the
books into which Caxton has introduced woodcuts,
giving twenty-seven figures, "without which
it may not lightly [easily] be understood." These
twenty-seven figures are diagrams, explanatory of
some of the scientific principles laid down in this
book; but there are eleven other cuts illustrative
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">{137}</a></span>
of other subjects treated in the work. An idea maybe
formed of the manner in which those cuts are
engraved from the following fac-simile of 'Music.'</p>

<div class="image-center">
  <img src="images/music.jpg" width="350" height="298" alt="music" />
</div>

<p>One of the most popular books of Caxton's translation
must unquestionably have been the '<i>History
of Reynard the Fox</i>.' It is held that this work
was composed in the twelfth century; and surely
the author must have been a man of high genius to
have constructed a fable which has been ever since
popular in all countries, and delights us even to
this hour. Caxton has no woodcuts to his edition,
to which the book subsequently owed a portion of
its attractions.</p>

<div class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">{138}</a></div>

<p>'<i>The Subtil Histories and Fables of Esop</i>,' translated
by Caxton from the French, were printed by
him in 1483, "The first year of the reign of King
Richard the Third." In the first leaf there is a
supposed portrait of Esop, a large rough woodcut,
exhibiting him as he is described, with a great
head, large visage, long jaws, sharp eyes, a short
neck, <i>curb</i>-backed, and so forth. There is a controversy
whether Richard the Third was a deformed
man or not. It is held by many that it was one of
the scandals put forth under his triumphant successor
(which scandal Shakspere has for ever made
current), that Richard was</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse quote2">"Cheated of feature by dissembling nature,</div>
<div class="verse">Deform'd, unfinish'd."</div>
</div>

</div>
</div>

<p class="nodent">It strikes us that Caxton would scarcely have
ventured, in the first year of King Richard III., to
exhibit a print of a hump-backed Esop (for any
print was then a rare thing), if his dread sovereign
had been remarkable amongst the people for a
similar defect. The conclusion of these fables of
Esop has a story told by Caxton as from himself,
which is a remarkable specimen of a plain narrative
style, with a good deal of sly humour:—</p>

<p>"Now then I will finish all these fables with
this tale that followeth, which a worshipful priest
and a parson told me late: he said that there were
dwelling at Oxenford two priests, both Masters
of Arts—of whom that one was quick and could
put himself forth; and that other was a good
simple priest. And so it happened that the master
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">{139}</a></span>
that was pert and quick was anon promoted to a
benefice or twain, and after to prebends, and for to
be a dean of a great prince's chapel, supposing and
weening that his fellow, the simple priest, should
never be promoted, but be always an annual, or,
at the most, a parish priest. So after a long time
that this worshipful man, this dean, came running
into a good parish with five or seven horses, like
a prelate, and came into the church of the said
parish, and found there this good simple man,
sometime his fellow, which came and welcomed
him lowly. And that other bade him 'Good morrow,
Master John,' and took him slightly by the
hand, and axed him where he dwelt.—And the
good man said, 'In this parish.' 'How,' said he,
'are ye here a sole priest, or a parish priest?'
'Nay, Sir,' said he, 'for lack of a better, though
I be not able nor worthy, I am parson and curate
of this parish.' And then that other vailed
[lowered] his bonnet, and said, 'Master Parson, I
pray you to be not displeased; I had supposed ye
had not been beneficed. But, master,' said he, 'I
pray you what is this benefice worth to you a
year?' 'Forsooth,' said the good simple man, 'I
wot never; for I make never accompts thereof,
how well I have had it four or five years.' 'And
know ye not,' said he, 'what it is worth?—it should
seem a good benefice.' 'No, forsooth,' said he,
'but I wot well what it shall be worth to me.'
'Why,' said he, 'what shall it be worth?' Forsooth,'
said he, 'if I do my true dealing in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">{140}</a></span>
cure of my parishes in preaching and teaching,
and do my part belonging to my cure, I shall have
heaven therefore. And if their souls be lost, or
any of them, by my default, I shall be punished
therefore. And hereof I am sure.' And with
that word the rich dean was abashed: and thought
he should be the better, and take more heed to
his cures and benefices than he had done. This
was a good answer of a good priest and an honest.
And herewith I finish this book, translated and
imprinted by me, William Caxton." The moral of
the fable is not obsolete.</p>

<p>One of Caxton's most splendid books, of which
he seems to have printed three editions, was '<i>The
Golden Legend</i>.' This is, indeed, an important
work, printed in double columns, and containing
between four and five hundred pages, which are
largely illustrated with woodcuts. It was not
without great caution, as we have already mentioned
(page 107), that Caxton proceeded with this
heavy and expensive undertaking. Happy would
it have been for all printers if puissant and virtuous
earls, and others in high places, had thought
it a duty to encourage knowledge by taking a
"reasonable quantity" of a great work; but
happier are we now, when, such assistance being
grudgingly bestowed or honestly despised, the
makers of books can depend upon something more
satisfying than the rich man's purse, which was
generally associated with "the proud man's contumely."</p>

<div class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">{141}</a></div>

<p>In the prologue to the 'Golden Legend' Caxton
recites several of the works which he had previously
"translated out of French into English at
the request of certain lords, ladies, and gentlemen."
Those recited are the 'Recueil of Troy,'
the 'Book of the Chess,' 'Jason,' the 'Mirror of
the World,' Ovid's 'Metamorphoses,' and 'Godfrey
of Boulogne.' It is remarkable that no printed
copy exists of Ovid's 'Metamorphoses;' but in the
library of Magdalen College, Cambridge, there is
a manuscript containing five books of the 'Metamorphoses,'
which purport to be translated by
Caxton. It was evidently a part of his plan for
the encouragement of liberal education, to present
a portion of the people with translations of the
classics through the ready means that were open
to him of re-translation from the French. Many
translators in later times have availed themselves
of such aids, without the honesty to indicate the
immediate sources of their versions. Caxton
printed '<i>The Book of Tully of Old Age</i>,' and
'<i>Tullius his Book of Friendship</i>.' He seems to
have had great difficulty in obtaining a copy of an
old translation of 'Tullius de Senectute.' The
Book 'De Amicitia' was translated by John, Earl
of Worcester, the celebrated adherent of the house
of York, who was beheaded in 1470. Caxton, we
think somewhat unnecessarily, limits the perusal
of the treatise on Old Age. "This book is not
requisite nor eke convenient for every rude and
simple man, which understandeth not of science
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">{142}</a></span>
nor cunning, and for such as have not heard of the
noble policy and prudence of the Romans; but for
noble, wise, and great lords, gentlemen, and merchants,
that have been and daily be occupied in matter
touching the public weal: and in especial unto
them that been passed their green age, and eke their
middle age, called virility, and been approached unto
<i>senectute</i>, called old and ancient age. Wherein they
may see how to suffer and bear the same patiently;
and what surety and virtue been in the same, and
have also cause to be joyous and glad that they
have escaped and passed the manifold perils and
doubteous adventures that been in juvente and
youth, as in this said book here following ye may
more plainly see."</p>

<p>'<i>The Book of Eneydos</i>,' compiled from Virgil, is
not a translation of Virgil's great epic, but a sort of
historical narrative formed upon the course of the
poet's great story. The most remarkable passage
of this book is that of Caxton's preface, in which
he complains of the unstedfastness of our language,
and the difficulty that he found between
plain, rude, and curious terms. (See page 5.)
In this translation he again limits his work to a
particular class of persons; as if he felt, which was
probably a prejudice of his time, that the inferior
members of the laity ought not to touch anything
that pertained to scholastic learning. He says,
"Forasmuch as this present book is not for a rude
uplandish man to labour therein, nor read it, but
only for a clerk and a noble gentleman that feeleth
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">{143}</a></span>
and understandeth in faits of arms, in love, and in
noble chivalry: therefore, in mean between both,
I have reduced and translated this said book into
our English, not over rude nor curious, but in such
terms as shall be understanden, by God's grace, according
to my copy."</p>

<p>'<i>The book called Cathon</i>' (Cato's Morals) was
destined by Caxton for a wider circulation:—"In
my judgment it is the best book for to be taught to
young children in schools, and also to people of
every age it is full convenient if it be well understanden."</p>

<p>Dr. Dibdin, in his 'Typographical Antiquities,'
says of Caxton, "Exclusively of the labours attached
to the working of his press as a new art,
our typographer contrived, though well stricken in
years, to translate not fewer than five thousand
closely printed folio pages. As a translator, therefore,
he ranks among the most laborious, and, I
would hope, not the least successful, of his tribe.
The foregoing conclusion is the result of a careful
enumeration of all the books translated as well as
printed by him; which [the translated books], if
published in the modern fashion, would extend to
nearly twenty-five octavo volumes!" The exact
nature of his labours seems, as might well be
imagined, to have been often determined by very
accidental circumstances. One noble lord requests
him to produce this book, and one worshipful gentleman
urges him to translate that. He says himself
of his Virgil, "After divers works made, translated,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">{144}</a></span>
and achieved, having no work in hand, I,
sitting in my study whereas lay many divers
pamphlets and books, happened that to my hand
came a little book in French, which late was translated
out of Latin by some noble clerk of France,
which book is named Eneydos, made in Latin by
that noble poet and great clerk Virgil." Some
books, indeed, he would be determined to print by
their existing popularity. Such were his two
editions of Chaucer's '<i>Canterbury Tales</i>' which
we may be sure, from his sound criticism, he felt
the necessity of promulgating to a much wider
circle than had been reached by the transcribers.
(See page 31.) Caxton was especially the devoted
printer of Chaucer. His truly honourable conduct
in venturing upon a new edition of the
'Canterbury Tales,' when he found his first was
incorrect, exhibits an example in the first printer
and the first publisher which the printers and publishers
of all subsequent times ought to reverence
and imitate. The early printers, English and
foreign, were indeed a high and noble race. They
did not set themselves up to be the patrons of
letters; they did not dispense their dole to scholars
grudgingly and thanklessly; they worked with
them; they encountered with them the risks of
profit and of fame; they were scholars themselves;
they felt the deep responsibility of their office;
they carried on the highest of all commerce in an
elevated temper; they were not mere hucksters
and chafferers. It was in no spirit of pride, it was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">{145}</a></span>
in the spirit of duty, that Caxton raised a table of
verses to Chaucer in Westminster Abbey. In his
edition of Boetius, which he gives us to understand
was translated by Master Geoffrey Chaucer, he
says, "And furthermore I desire and require you,
that of your charity ye would pray for the soul
of the said worshipful man Geoffrey Chaucer, first
translator of this said book into English, and embellisher
in making the said language ornate and
fair, which shall endure perpetually, and therefore
he ought eternally to be remembered; of whom
the body and corps lieth buried in the Abbey of
Westminster, beside London, to fore the chapel of
Saint Benet, by whose sepulture is written on a
table, hanging on a pillar, his epitaph made by a
poet-laureate, whereof the copy followeth." The
writer of the Life of Chaucer, in the 'Biographia
Britannica,' says, "It is very probable he lay beneath
a large stone of gray marble in the pavement
where the monument to Mr. Dryden now stands,
which is in the front of that chapel [St. Benet's],
upon the erecting of which [Dryden's monument]
this stone was taken up, and sawed in pieces to
made good the pavement. At least this seems best
to answer the description of the place given by
Caxton." There appears, according to the ancient
editors of Chaucer's works, to have been two Latin
lines upon his tombstone previous to the epitaph
set up upon a pillar by Caxton. That epitaph was
written by Stephanus Suriganius, poet-laureate of
Milan. The monument of Chaucer, which still
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">{146}</a></span>
remains in the Abbey, around which the ashes of
Spenser, and Beaumont, and Drayton, and Jonson,
and Cowley, and Dryden, have clustered, was erected
by an Oxford student in 1555. There might have
been worse things preserved, and yet to be looked
upon, in that Abbey, than honest old Caxton's epitaph
upon him whom he calls "the worshipful
father and first founder and embellisher of ornate
eloquence in our English."</p>

<p>As the popularity of Chaucer demanded various
impressions of his works from Caxton's press, so
did he print an apparently cheap edition of Gower's
'<i>Confessio Amantis</i>,' in small type. Two of Lydgate's
works were also printed by him. The more
fugitive poetry which issued from his press has probably
all perished. In one of the volumes of Old
Ballads in the British Museum is a fragment of a
poem, of which nothing further is known, telling
the story of some heroine that lived a life of unvaried
solitude:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse quote2">"From her childhood I find that she fled</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Office of woman, and to wood she went,</div>
<div class="verse">And many a wild harte's blood she shed</div>
<div class="verse indent2">With arrows broad that she to them sent."</div>
</div>

</div>
</div>

<p>One of the most important uses of early printing
in England is to be found in fragments of the Statutes
of the Realm, made in the first parliament of
Richard III., and in the first, second, and third
parliaments of Henry VII., some leaves of which
exist. That the promulgation of the laws would
soon follow the introduction of the art of printing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">{147}</a></span>
was a natural consequence. Early in the next
century the publication of Acts of Parliament became
an important branch of trade; and a King's
Printer was formally appointed. Up to our own
times all the cheapening processes of the art of
printing had been withheld, at least in their results,
from that branch of printing which was to instruct
the people in their new laws. The Statutes were
the dearest of books, and kept dear for no other
purpose but to preserve one relic of the monopolies
of the days of the Stuarts. The abuse has been
partially remedied.</p>

<p>We have purposely reserved to the conclusion
of this account of the productions of Caxton's press,
some notice of those works to the undertaking of
which he seems to have been moved by his
familiarity with the frequenters of the court,—those
whose talk was of tournaments and battles,
of gallant knights and noble dames; and whose
heads, like that of the worthy Knight of La
Mancha, were "full of nothing but enchantments,
quarrels, battles, challenges, wounds, complaints,
amours, torments." It is quite marvellous to look
upon the enthusiasm with which Master Caxton
deals with these matters in the days when he had
achieved</p>

<p class="center small">"The silver livery of advised age."</p>

<p class="nodent">It offers us one of the many proofs of the energy
and youthfulness of his character. We have
already quoted his address to the knights of England
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">{148}</a></span>
(see page 66), given in his '<i>Book of the Order
of Chivalry</i>,' supposed to have been printed in
1484. After this address he proposes a question
which shows that he considers he has fallen upon
degenerate days. "How many knights be there
now in England that have the use and the exercise
of a knight? that is to wit, that he knoweth his
horse, and his horse him; that is to say, he being
ready at a point to have all thing that belongeth
to a knight, an horse that is according and broken
after his hand, his armour and harness suit, and so
forth, <i>et cetera</i>. I suppose, an a due search should
be made, there should be many founden that lack:
the more pity is! I would it pleased our sovereign
Lord, that twice or thrice a year, or at the least
once, he would cry jousts of peace, to the end that
every knight should have horse and harness, and
also the use and craft of a knight, and also to
tourney one against one, or two against two; and
the best to have a prize, a diamond or jewel, such
as should please the prince. This should cause
gentlemen to resort to the ancient customs of
chivalry to great fame and renown: and also to be
alway ready to serve their prince when he shall
call them, or have need." There is always some
compensating principle arising in the world to prevent
its too rapid degeneracy; and thus, although
the tournament has long ceased, except as a farce,
there is many a noble who may still say, "That
he knoweth his horse, and his horse him," through
the attractions of Melton Mowbray and Epsom.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">{149}</a></span>
Hunting and horse-racing have done much to keep
up our pristine civilization. In '<i>The Fait of Arms
and Chivalry</i>,' 1489, Caxton undertakes a higher
strain. He translates this book, "to the end that
every gentleman born to arms and all manner men
of war, captains, soldiers, victuallers, and all other,
should have knowledge how they ought to behave
them in the faits of war and of battles." And yet,
strange to relate, this belligerent book was written
by a fair lady, Christina of Pisa. The '<i>Histories
of King Arthur</i>,' printed in 1485, lands us at
once into all the legendary hero-worship of the
middle ages. Caxton, in his preface to this translation
by Sir Thomas Mallory, gives us a pretty full
account of the Nine Worthies, "the best that ever
were;" and then he goes on to expound his reasons
for once doubting whether the Histories of Arthur
were anything but fables, and how he was convinced
that he was a real man. But surely in these
chivalrous books Caxton had an honest purpose.
He exhorts noble lords and ladies, with all other
estates, to read this said book, "wherein they shall
well find many joyous and pleasant histories, and
noble and renowned acts of humanity, gentleness,
and chivalries; for herein may be seen noble
chivalry, courtesy, humanity, friendliness, hardiness,
love, friendship, cowardice, murder, hate,
virtue, and sin. Do after the good, and leave the
evil, and it shall bring you to good fame and renown."
'<i>The Life of Charles the Great</i>' succeeded
the 'Histories of King Arthur;' for, according to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">{150}</a></span>
Caxton, Charlemagne was the second of the three
worthy. It is in the preface to this book that
Caxton says that his father and mother in his
youth sent him to school, by which, by the sufferance
of God, he gets his living.</p>

<p>We may conclude this imperfect description of
Caxton's labours in the literature of romance and
chivalry, so characteristic of the age in which he
lived, with the following extract from the '<i>History
of King Blanchardine and Queen Eglantine his
wife</i>,' which he translated from the French, at the
command of the Duchess of Somerset, mother of
King Henry VII. The passage shows us that the
old printers were dealers in foreign books as well as
in their own productions: "Which book I had
long to fore <i>sold</i> to my said lady, and knew well
that the story of it was honest and joyful to all
virtuous young noble gentlemen and women, for to
read therein, as for their pastime. For under correction,
in my judgment, histories of noble feats
and valiant acts of arms and war, which have been
achieved in old time of many noble princes, lords,
and knights, are as well for to see and know their
valiantness for to stand in the special grace and
love of their ladies, and in like wise for gentle
young ladies and demoiselles for to learn to be
stedfast and constant in their part to them, that
they once have promised and agreed to, such as
have put their lives oft in jeopardy for to please
them to stand in grace, as it is to occupy the ken
and study overmuch in books of contemplation."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">{151}</a></span>
This is a defence of novel-reading which we could
scarcely have expected at so early a period of our
literature.</p>

<p>In 1490 Caxton was approaching, according to
all his biographers, to the great age of fourscore.
About this period he appears to have consigned
some relation to the grave, perhaps his wife. In
the first year of the churchwardens' accounts of the
parish of St. Margaret's, Westminster, from May
17, 1490, to June 3, 1492, there is the following
entry:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse quote2">"Item; atte bureynge of Mawde Caxton</div>
<div class="verse indent2">for torches and tapers ... iiijˢ ijᵈ."</div>
</div>

</div>
</div>

<p class="nodent">On the 15th June, 1490, Caxton finished translating
out of French into English '<i>The Art and
Craft to know well to die</i>.' The commencement
of the book is an abrupt one: "When it is
so, that what a man maketh or doeth it is made
to come to some end, and if the thing be good and
well made it must needs come to good end; then
by better and greater reason every man ought to
intend in such wise to live in this world, in keeping
the commandments of God, that he may come to a
good end. And then out of this world, full of
wretchedness and tribulations, he may go to heaven
unto God and his saints, unto joy perdurable."</p>

<p>That the end of Caxton was a good end we have
little doubt. We have a testimony, which we shall
presently see, that he <i>worked</i> to the end. He
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">{152}</a></span>
worked upon a book of pious instruction to the last
day of his life. He was not slumbering when his
call came. He was still labouring at the work for
which he was born.</p>

<p>There is the following entry in the churchwardens'
accounts of the parish of St. Margaret, in
the second year of the period we have above mentioned:—</p>

<p class="gist">The Chapel—The Companions—Increase of Readers—Books make
Readers—Caxton's Types—Wynkyn's Dream—The first Paper-mill.</p>

<p class="nodent"><span class="smc">It</span> was evensong time when, after a day of listlessness,
the printers in the Almonry at Westminster
prepared to close the doors of their workshop. This
was a tolerably spacious room, with a carved oaken
roof. The setting sun shone brightly into the
chamber, and lighted up such furniture as no other
room in London could then exhibit. Between the
columns which supported the roof stood two presses
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">{154}</a></span>
—ponderous machines. A <i>form</i> of types lay unread
upon the <i>table</i> of one of these presses; the
other was empty. There were <i>cases</i> ranged between
the opposite columns; but there was no <i>copy</i>
suspended ready for the compositors to proceed
with in the morning. No heap of wet paper was
piled upon the floor. The <i>balls</i>, removed from the
presses, were rotting in a corner. The <i>ink-blocks</i>
were dusty, and a thin film had formed over the
oily pigment. He who had set these machines in
motion, and filled the whole space with the activity
of mind, was dead. His daily work was ended.</p>

<p>Three grave-looking men, decently clothed in
black, were girding on their swords. Their caps
were in their hands. The door opened, and the
chief of the workmen came in. It was Wynkyn
de Worde. With short speech, but with looks of
deep significance, he called a <i>chapel</i>—the printer's
parliament—a conclave as solemn and as omnipotent
as the Saxons' Witenagemot. Wynkyn was
the Father of the Chapel.</p>

<p>The four drew their high stools round the <i>imposing-stone</i>—those
stools on which they had sat
through many a day of quiet labour, steadily working
to the distant end of some ponderous folio,
without hurry or anxiety. Upon the stone lay two
uncorrected folio pages—a portion of the 'Lives of
the Fathers.' The <i>proof</i> was not returned. He
that they had followed a few days before to his grave
in Saint Margaret's church had lifted it once back
to his failing eyes,—and then they closed in night.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">{155}</a></span></p>

<p>"Companions," said Wynkyn—(surely that word
"<i>companions</i>" tells of the antiquity of printing,
and of the old love and fellowship that subsisted
amongst its craft)—"companions, the good work
will not stop."</p>

<p>"Wynkyn," said Richard Pynson, "who is to
carry on the work?"</p>

<p>"I am ready," answered Wynkyn.</p>

<p>A faint expression of joy rose to the lips of these
honest men, but it was damped by the remembrance
of him they had lost.</p>

<p>"He died," said Wynkyn, "as he lived. The
Lives of the Holy Fathers is finished, as far as the
translator's labour. There is the rest of the copy.
Read the words of the last page, which <i>I</i> have
written:—</p>

<p>"Thus endeth the most virtuous history of the
devout and right-renowned lives of holy fathers
living in desert, worthy of remembrance to all well-disposed
persons, which hath been translated out of
French into English by William Caxton, of Westminster,
late dead, and finished at the last day of
his life."<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_14" id="Ref_14" href="#Foot_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>The tears were in all their eyes; and "God rest
his soul!" was whispered around.</p>

<p>"Companion," said William Machlinia, "is not
this a hazardous enterprise?"</p>

<p>"I have encouragement," replied Wynkyn;—"the
Lady Margaret, his Highness' mother, gives
me aid. So droop not, fear not. We will carry
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">{156}</a></span>
on the work briskly in our good master's house.—So
fill the case."<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_15" id="Ref_15" href="#Foot_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>A shout almost mounted to the roof.</p>

<p>"But why should we fear? You, Machlinia,
you, Lettou, and you, dear Richard Pynson, if you
choose not to abide with your old companion here,
there is work for you all in these good towns of
Westminster, London, and Southwark. You have
money; you know where to buy types. Printing
<i>must</i> go forward."</p>

<p>"Always full of heart," said Pynson. "But you
forget the statute of King Richard; we cannot say
'God rest his soul,' for our old master scarcely ever
forgave him putting Lord Rivers to death. You
forget the statute. We ought to know it, for we
printed it. I can turn to the file in a moment.
It is the Act touching the merchants of Italy, which
forbids them selling their wares in this realm.
Here it is: 'Provided always that this Act, or any
part thereof, in no wise extend or be prejudicial of
any let, hurt, or impediment to any artificer or
merchant stranger, of what nation or country he
be or shall be of, for bringing into this realm, or
selling by retail or otherwise, of any manner of
books written or imprinted.' Can we stand up
against that, if we have more presses than the old
press of the Abbey of Westminster?"</p>

<p>"Ay, truly, we can, good friend," briskly answered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">{157}</a></span>
Wynkyn. "Have we any books in our
stores? Could we ever print books fast enough?
Are there not readers rising up on all sides? Do
we depend upon the court? The mercers and the
drapers, the grocers and the spicers of the city,
crowd here for our books. The rude uplandish
men even take our books; they that our good master
rather vilipended. The tapsters and taverners have
our books. The whole country-side cries out for
our ballads and our Robin Hood stories; and, to
say the truth, the citizen's wife is as much taken
with our King Arthurs and King Blanchardines as
the most noble knight that Master Caxton ever
desired to look upon in his green days of jousts in
Burgundy. So fill the case."<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_16" id="Ref_16" href="#Foot_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>"But if foreigners bring books into England,"
said cautious William Machlinia, "there will be
more books than readers."</p>

<p>"Books make readers," rejoined Wynkyn. "Do
you remember how timidly even our bold master
went on before he was safe in his sell? Do you
forget how he asked this lord to take a copy,
and that knight to give him something in fee;
and how he bargained for his summer venison and
his winter venison, as an encouragement in his
ventures? But he found a larger market than he
ever counted upon, and so shall we all. Go ye
forth, my brave fellows. Stay not to work for me,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">{158}</a></span>
if you can work better for yourselves. I fear no
rivals."</p>

<p>"Why, Wynkyn," interposed Pynson, "you talk
as if printing were as necessary as air; books as
food, or clothing, or fire."</p>

<p>"And so they will be some day. What is to
stop the want of books? Will one man have the
command of books, and another desire them not?
The time may come when every man shall require
books."</p>

<p>"Perhaps," said Lettou, who had an eye to
printing the Statutes, "the time may come when
every man shall want to read an Act of Parliament,
instead of the few lawyers who buy our Acts
now."</p>

<p>"Hardly so," grunted Wynkyn.</p>

<p>"Or perchance you think that, when our sovereign
liege meets his Peers and Commons in Parliament,
it were well to print a book some month or
two after, to tell what the said Parliament said, as
well as ordained?"</p>

<p>"Nay, nay, you run me hard," said Wynkyn.</p>

<p>"And if within a month, why not within a day?
Why shouldn't we print the words as fast as they
are spoken? We only want fairy fingers to pick
up our types, and presses that Doctor Faustus and
his devils may some day make, to tell all London
to-morrow morning what is done this morning in
the palace at Westminster."</p>

<p>"Prithee, be serious," ejaculated Wynkyn.
"Why do you talk such gallymaufry? I was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">{159}</a></span>
speaking of possible things; and I really think the
day may come when one person in a thousand may
read books and buy books, and we shall have a
trade almost as good as that of armourers and
fletchers."</p>

<p>"The Bible!" exclaimed Pynson; "O that we
might print the Bible! I know of a copy of
Wickliffe's Bible. That were indeed a book to
print!"</p>

<p>"I have no doubt, Richard," replied Wynkyn,
"that the happy time may come when a Bible
shall be chained in every church, for every Christian
man to look upon. You remember when our
brother Hunte showed us the chained books in
the Library at Oxford. So a century or two hence
a Bible may be found in every parish. Twelve
thousand parishes in England! We should want
more paper in that good day, Master Richard."</p>

<p>"You had better fancy at once," said Lettou,
"that every housekeeper will want a Bible!
Heaven save the mark, how some men's imaginations
run away with them!"</p>

<p>"I cannot see," interposed Machlinia, "how we
can venture upon more presses in London. Here
are two. They have been worked well, since the
day when they were shipped at Cologne. Here
are five good founts of type, as much as a thousand
weight—<i>Great Primer</i>, <i>Double Pica</i>, <i>Pica</i>—a
large and a small face, and <i>Long Primer</i>. They
have well worked; they are pretty nigh worn out.
What man would risk such an adventure, after our
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">{161}</a></span>
good old master? He was a favourite at court
and in cloister. He was well patronized. Who is
to patronize us?"</p>

  <div class="caption">
    <p>Caxton's Type.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>"The people, I tell you," exclaimed Wynkyn.
"The babe in the cradle wants an Absey-book;
the maid at her distaff wants a ballad; the priest
wants his Pie; the young lover wants a romance of
chivalry to read to his mistress; the lawyer wants
his Statutes; the scholar wants his Virgil and
Cicero. They will all want more the more they
are supplied. How many in England have a book
at all, think you? Let us make books cheaper by
printing more of them at once. The churchwardens
of St. Margaret's asked me six-and-eightpence
yesterday for the volume that our master left the
parish;<span class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_17" id="Ref_17" href="#Foot_17">[17]</a></span>
for not a copy can I get, if we should
want to print again. Six-and-eightpence! That
was exactly what he charged his customers for
the volume. Print five hundred instead of two
hundred, and we could sell it for three-and-four-pence."</p>

<p>"And ruin ourselves," said Machlinia. "Master
Wynkyn, I shall fear to work for you if you go on
so madly. What has turned your head?"</p>

<p>"Hearken," said Wynkyn. "The day our good
master was buried I had no stomach for my home.
I could not eat. I could scarcely look on the sunshine.
There was a chill at my heart. I took the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">{162}</a></span>
key of our office, for you all were absent, and I
came here in the deep twilight. I sat down in
Master Caxton's chair. I sat till I fancied I saw
him moving about, as he was wont to move, in his
furred gown, explaining this copy to one of us, and
shaking his head at that proof to the other. I fell
asleep. Then I dreamed a dream, a wild dream,
but one that seems to have given me hope and
courage. There I sat, in the old desk at the head
of this room, straining my eyes at the old proofs.
The room gradually expanded. The four <i>frames</i>
went on multiplying, till they became innumerable.
I saw <i>case</i> piled upon <i>case</i>; and <i>form</i> side by side
with <i>form</i>. All was bustle, and yet quiet, in that
room. Readers passed to and fro; there was a
glare of many lights; all seemed employed in producing
one folio, an enormous folio. In an instant
the room had changed. I heard a noise as of many
wheels. I saw sheets of paper covered with ink as
quickly as I pick up this type. Sheet upon sheet,
hundreds of sheets, thousands of sheets, came from
forth the wheels—flowing in unstained, like corn
from the hopper, and coming out printed, like
flour to the sack. They flew abroad as if carried
over the earth by the winds. Again the scene
changed. In a cottage, an artificer's cottage, though
it had many things in it which belong to princes'
palaces, I saw a man lay down his basket of tools
and take up one of these sheets. He read it; he
laughed, he looked angry; tears rose to his eyes;
and then he read aloud to his wife and children.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">{163}</a></span>
I asked him to show me the sheet. It was wet;
it contained as many types as our 'Mirror of the
World.' But it bore the date of 1844. I looked
around, and I saw shelves of books against that
cottage wall—large volumes and small volumes;
and a boy opened one of the large volumes and
showed me numberless block-cuts; and the artificer
and his wife and his children gathered round me,
all looking with glee towards their books, and the
good man pointed to an inscription on his bookshelves,
and I read these words,</p>

  <p class="center smc">My Library a Dukedom.</p>

<p class="nodent">I woke in haste; and, whether awake or dreaming
I know not, my master stood beside me, and smilingly
exclaimed, 'This is my fruit.' I have encouragement
in this dream."</p>

<p>"Friend Wynkyn," said Pynson, "these are distempered
visions. The press may go forward; I
think it will go forward. But I am of the belief
that the press will never work but for the great
and the learned, to any purpose of profit to the
printer. How can we ever hope to send our wares
abroad? We may hawk our ballads and our merry
jests through London; but the citizens are too
busy to heed them, and the apprentices and serving
men too poor to buy them. To the country we
cannot send them. Good lack, imagine the poor
pedler tramping with a pack of books to Bristol or
Winchester! Before he could reach either city
through our wild roads, he would have his throat
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">{164}</a></span>
cut or be starved. Master Wynkyn, we shall
always have a narrow market till the king mends
his highways, and that will never be."</p>

<p>"I am rather for trying, Master Wynkyn," said
Lettou, "some good cutting jest against our friends
in the Abbey, such as Dan Chaucer expounded
touching the friars. That would sell in these precincts."</p>

<p>"Hush!" exclaimed Wynkyn: "the good fathers
are our friends; and though some murmur against
them, we might have worse masters."</p>

<p>"I wish they would let us print the Bible though,"
ejaculated Pynson.</p>

<p>"The time will come, and that right soon," exclaimed
the hopeful Wynkyn.</p>

<p>"So be it," said they one and all.</p>

<p>"But what fair sheet of paper is that in your
hand, good Wynkyn?" said Pynson.</p>

<p>"Master Richard, we are all moving onward.
This is English-made paper. Is it not better than
the brown thick paper we have had from over the
sea? How <i>he</i> would have rejoiced in this accomplishment
of John Tate's longing trials! Ay,
Master Richard, this fair sheet was made in the new
mill at Hertford; and well am I minded to use it
in our Bartholomæeus, which I shall straightly put
in hand, when the Formschneider is ready. I have
thought anent it; I have resolved on it; and I
have indited some rude verses touching the matter,

<h3>APPENDIX A.</h3>

<p class="nodent"><span class="smc">The</span>
following account of the invention of printing is given
by an ancient German chronicler of the name of Trithemius,
who appears to have personally known one of the three persons
who clearly seem to have the best title to be called the
inventors of printing.</p>

<p>"At this time, in the city of Mentz on the Rhine in Germany,
and not in Italy, as some have erroneously written,
that wonderful and then unheard-of art of printing and characterizing
books was invented and devised by John Guttenberger,
a citizen of Mentz, who, having expended almost the
whole of his property in the invention of this art, and on
account of the difficulties which he experienced on all sides,
was about to abandon it altogether; when, by the advice,
and through the means, of John Fust [or Faust], likewise a
citizen of Mentz, he succeeded in bringing it to perfection.
At first they formed [engraved] the characters or letters in
written order on blocks of wood, and in this manner they
printed the vocabulary called a 'Catholicon.' But with these
forms [blocks] they could print nothing else, because the
characters could not be transposed in these tablets, but were
engraved thereon, as we have said. To this invention succeeded
a more subtle one, for they found out the means of
cutting the forms of all the letters of the alphabet, which they
called matrices, from which again they cast characters of
copper or tin of sufficient hardness to resist the necessary
pressure, which they had before engraved by hand. And
truly, as I learned thirty years since from Peter Opilio
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">{168}</a></span>
(Schoeffer) de Gernsheim, citizen of Mentz, who was the
son-in-law of the first inventor of this art, great difficulties
were experienced after the first invention of this art of printing,
for in printing the Bible, before they had completed the
third quaternion (or gathering of four sheets), 4000 florins
were expended. This Peter Schoeffer, whom we have above
mentioned, first servant and afterwards son-in-law to the first
inventor, John Fust, as we have said, an ingenious and sagacious
man, discovered the more easy method of casting the
types, and thus the art was reduced to the complete state in
which it now is. These three kept this method of printing
secret for some time, until it was divulged by some of their
workmen, without whose aid this art could not have been
exercised; it was first developed at Strasburg, and soon became
known to other nations. And thus much of the admirable
and subtle art of printing may suffice—the first inventors
were citizens of Mentz. These three first inventors of Printing,
(videlicet) John Guttenberger, John Fust, and Peter
Schoeffer, his son-in-law, lived at Mentz, in the house called
Zum Jungen, which has ever since been called the Printing-office."</p>

<p>The invention of Schoeffer, which, whatever might have
been its first mechanical imperfections, undoubtedly completed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">{169}</a></span>
the principle of printing, is more particularly described
in an early document, which is given in several learned
works on typography, as proceeding from a relation of Fust.
It is as follows:—"Peter Schoeffer, of Gernsheim, perceiving
his master Fust's design, and being himself ardently desirous
to improve the art, found out (by the good providence of God)
the method of cutting (<i>incidendi</i>) the characters in a matrix,
that the letters might each be singly cast, instead of being
cut. He privately cut matrices for the whole alphabet; and
when he showed his master the letters cast from these
matrices, Fust was so pleased with the contrivance, that he
promised Peter to give him his only daughter Christina in
marriage; a promise which he soon after performed. But
there were as many difficulties at first with these letters, as
there had been before with wooden ones; the metal being too
soft to support the force of the impression: but this defect
was soon remedied by mixing the metal with a substance
which sufficiently hardened it." John Schoeffer, the son of
Peter, who was also a printer, confirms this account, adding,
"Fust and Schoeffer concealed this new improvement
by administering an oath of secrecy to all whom they intrusted,
till the year 1462, when, by the dispersion of their
servants into different countries, at the sacking of Mentz
by the Archbishop Adolphus, the invention was publicly
divulged."</p>

<p>From the time of Caxton's press to that of Thomas Hacket,
we have the enumeration of 2926 books in Dr. Dibdin's work.
The 'Typographical Antiquities' of Ames and Herbert comes
down to a later period. They recorded the names of three
hundred and fifty printers in England and Scotland, or of foreign
printers engaged in producing books for England, that
flourished between 1474 and 1600. The same authors have
recorded the titles (we have counted with sufficient accuracy
to make the assertion) of nearly 10,000 distinct works printed
amongst us during the same period. Many of these works,
however, were only single sheets; but on the other hand,
there are doubtless many not here registered. Dividing the
total number of books printed during these 130 years, we
find that the average number of distinct works produced each
year was 75.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER I.</h3>

<p class="gist">Cheap Popular Literature—Conditions of Cheapness—Popular Literature
of Elizabeth's reign—Who were the readers.</p>

<p class="nodent"><span class="smc">The</span>
history of Cheap Popular Literature is a long
and instructive chapter of the history of the condition
of the People. Before the invention of printing
there was little literature that could be called
popular, and none that could be called cheap. But in
the very earliest stages of the press all books would
be comparatively cheap, and all literature to a certain
extent popular. Our first printer, as we regard
his works, had a most especial eye to the largest
number of readers. We have no record of the
price of his books beyond the fact that one of them
was sold for 6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i>, a price equal to that of a
quarter of wheat. But the subjects of his books,
for the most part, show that he thought it his
especial business to simplify knowledge, and to
furnish reading for amusement. We can scarcely
call any of his books learned. What there is of
science in them was of a popular sort, and illustrated
by diagrams. The histories were those of our old
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">{180}</a></span>
legendary chronicles, as attractive even as the romances
of chivalry which accompanied them. His
poetry was chiefly that of one of the great minds
whose essential attribute is that of universality.
Caxton went to the largest number of readers that
his age presented to him.</p>

<p>It is a remarkable characteristic of the first
century of printing, not only in this country, but
wherever a press was erected, that the highest and
most constant efforts of the new art were addressed
to the diffusion of the old stores of knowledge,
rather than to an enlargement of the stores. The
early professors of the art on the continent, in Germany,
Italy, and France, were scholars who knew
the importance of securing the world's inheritance
of the knowledge of Greece and Rome from any
further destruction, such as the scattered manuscripts
of the ancient poets, orators, and historians
had experienced, through neglect and ignorance.
The press would put them fairly beyond the reach
of any new waste. But after the first half-century
of printing, when these manuscripts had been copied
in type, and the public libraries and the princes
and nobles of Europe had been supplied, a fresh
want arose out of the satisfaction of the former
want. Men of letters, who did not belong to the
class of the rich, anxiously demanded copies of the
ancient classics; and their demands were not
made in vain. The Alduses, and Stephenses, and
Plantins, did not hold it good to keep books dear
for the advancement of letters; they anxiously desired
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">{181}</a></span>
to make them cheap, and they produced,
therefore, not expensive folios only, as their predecessors
had done, but neat and compactly printed
octavos and duodecimos, for the general market.
The instant that they did this, the foundations of
literature were widened and deepened. They probably
at first over-rated the demand; indeed, we
know they did so, and they suffered in consequence.
But the time was sure to come when their labours
would be rewarded; and, at any rate, they were at
once placed beyond a servile dependence upon
patrons. When they had their customers in every
great city and university, they did not wait for the
approving nod of a pope or a cardinal before they
began to print.</p>

<p>A new demand very soon followed upon the first
demand for cheap copies of the ancient classics, and
this was even more completely the demand of the
people. The doctrines of the Reformation had proclaimed
the Bible as the best spiritual guide and
teacher, and the people would have Bibles. The
first English Bible was bought up and burnt; those
who bought the Bibles contributed capital for
making new Bibles, and those who burnt the Bibles
advertised them. The first printers of the Bible
were, however, cautious; they did not see the
number of readers upon which they were to rely
for a sale. In 1540 Grafton printed but 500
copies of his complete edition of the Scriptures;
and yet, so great was the rush to this new supply
of the most important knowledge, that we have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">{182}</a></span>
existing 326 editions of the English Bible, or parts
of the Bible, printed between 1526 and 1600.</p>

<p>The early English printers did not attempt what
the continental ones were doing for the ancient
classics. Down to 1540 no Greek book had appeared
from an English press. Oxford had only
printed a part of Cicero's Epistles; Cambridge, no
ancient writer whatever: only three or four old
Roman writers had been reprinted, at that period,
throughout England. But a great deal was done
for public instruction by the course which our early
printers took; for, as one of them says, "Divers
famous clerks and learned men translated and made
many noble works into our English tongue, whereby
there was much more plenty and abundance of
English used than there was in times past." The
English nobility were, probably, for more than the
first half-century of English printing, the great encouragers
of our press: they required translations
and abridgments of the classics, versions of French
and Italian romances, old chronicles, and helps to
devout exercises. Caxton and his successors abundantly
supplied these wants; and the impulse to
most of their exertions was given by the growing
demand for literary amusement on the part of the
great. Caxton, as we have seen, speaking of his
'Boke of Eneydos,' says, "This present book is not
for a rude uplandish man to labour therein, nor
read it." But a great change was working in
Europe; the "rude uplandish man," if he gave
promise of talent, was sent to school. The priests
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">{183}</a></span>
strove with the laity for the education of the people;
and not only in Protestant but in Catholic countries,
were schools and universities everywhere
founded. Here, again, was a new source of employment
for the press—A, B, C's, or Abseys, Primers,
Catechisms, Grammars, Dictionaries, were
multiplied in every direction. Books became, also,
during this period, the tools of professional men.
There were not many works of medicine, but a great
many of law; and even the people required instruction
in the ordinances they were called upon to obey,
which they received in the form of proclamations.</p>

<p>The course of the early printers was based upon
the principle that they could produce books cheaper
by the press than by the scribe. This point once
established, the next fact would be also clear—that
the more impressions they printed the cheaper the
book could be afforded. Beyond this great fact
there was a difficulty. There would arise in their
minds the same doubt which has puzzled all
printers and booksellers from the time of Caxton
to our times; which is at the bottom of all controversies
about dear books and low-priced books
at the present hour; and which will continue to
perplex the producers of books, even should the
entire population beyond infancy become readers,
and have the means of purchasing books in some
form or other. That question is simply a commercial
one, and is perfectly independent of any
schemes of public or private generosity for the enlightenment
of the people; it is—Given the subject
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">{184}</a></span>
of a book, its mode of treatment, the celebrity
or otherwise of its author, its amount of matter—what
is the natural limit of its first sale, and the
necessary ratio of its published price? If the probable
demand be under-rated, there will be a high
price, which will restrict the natural demand; and
if over-rated, there will be a low price, which will
curtail the natural profit. This is scarcely a question
for enthusiasts for cheapness to decide, upon
the broad assertion that a large sale of low-priced
books will be more profitable than a small sale of
high-priced books.</p>

<p>In 1825, Archibald Constable, then the great
publisher, propounded to the then 'Great Unknown'
his plan for revolutionising "the art and
traffic of bookselling." He exhibited the annual
schedule of assessed taxes, having reckoned the
number of persons who paid for each separate article
of luxury; and from that document he calculated
that, if he produced every year "twelve
volumes so good that millions must wish to have
them, and so cheap that every butcher's callant
may have them, if he please to let me tax him sixpence
a week," he should sell them, "not by thousands
or tens of thousands, but by hundreds of
thousands—ay, by millions." It is recorded that
a worthy divine, instructing his bookseller to publish
a sermon of his composition, decided that at
least twelve thousand should be the number printed,
he having calculated that one copy would be
required in each parish by the clergyman alone, to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">{185}</a></span>
say nothing of chance customers. These statistics
were ingenious, but they were not safe guides.
The callants did not consent to be taxed sixpence
a week; and the rectors and curates did not rush
to St. Paul's Churchyard to buy up the limited
impression of the sermon.</p>

<p>But the Edinburgh publisher, and the rural
divine, were nevertheless right in their endeavour
to find some principle upon which they could
determine the probable demand for a literary work.
Constable proposed to himself the union of goodness
and cheapness, to create a demand that (still
using his own words) would have made him "richer
than the possession of all the copyrights of all the
quartos that ever were, or will be, hot-pressed."
The goodness without the cheapness might have
produced little change in the market; the cheapness
without the goodness might have been more
influential But, with the truest combination of
these qualities, there is nothing so easy or so common
as to over-rate a demand in the commerce of
books. The price of a book aspiring to the greatest
popularity can only be settled by an estimate of
the probable number of readers at any one time
in the community, and by a still more difficult
estimate of the sort of reading which is likely
to interest the greatest number. The same difficulty
arises with regard to every new book, and
has always arisen. The amount of the "reading
public," with its almost endless subdivisions, arising
out of station, or age, or average intelligence, or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">{186}</a></span>
prevailing taste, is very difficult to be estimated in
our own day; and there are not many authentic
details ready to our hand upon which we can make
an estimate for any past period. We will endeavour,
out of these scanty landmarks, to collect
some facts relating to the former state and progressive
extension of the realms of print.</p>

<p>It is no modern discovery that a book cheap
enough for the many amongst reading people to
buy, and at the same time a book which the
many would have a strong desire to buy, would be
more advantageous to the manufacturer of books
than a dear book which the few only could buy,
and which the few only would desire to buy.
There is preserved, in the handwriting of Christopher
Barker, in 1582, 'A Note of the offices and
other special licences for printing granted by her
Majesty, with a conjecture of their valuation.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_18" id="Ref_18" href="#Foot_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>This worthy printer to the Queen probably a little
under-rated his own gains, when he says that the
whole Bible requires so great a cost, that his predecessors
kept the realm twelve years without venturing
a single edition, but that he had desperately
adventured to print four in a year and a half,
expending about 3000<i>l.</i>, to the certain ruin of his
wife and family if he had died in the time. Of
these four editions, three were in folio, and one in
quarto. The sale of the folios would necessarily be
limited by the cost, in the way that the same unhappy
patentee complains of as to his Book of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">{187}</a></span>
Common Prayer, "which few or none do buy
except the minister." But how stands the sale of
smaller and less expensive books? Mr. Daye
prints the Psalms in metre, which book, "being
occupied of all sorts of men, women, and children,
and requiring no great stock for the furnishing
thereof, is therefore gainful." The small Catechism
is "also a profitable copy, for that it is general."
Mr. Seres prints the Morning and Evening Prayer,
with the Collects and the Litany; and where poor
Mr. Barker sells one Book of Common Prayer,
"he (Seres) furnisheth the whole parishes throughout
the realm, which are commonly a hundred to
one." But with all his laments and jealousies,
Queen Elizabeth's printer, in those anti-commercial
days, had hit the sound principle that is at the
root of the commerce of books. There is one of
the printers, he says, whose patent contains all
dictionaries in all tongues, all chronicles and histories
whatsoever; and his position is thus described:—"If
he print competent numbers of each to maintain
his charges, all England, Scotland, and much
more, were not able to utter them; and if he should
print but a few of each volume, the prices would be
exceedingly great, and he in more danger to be
undone than likely to gain." Here are the Scylla
and Charybdis of the book-trade. Let "all good
books on their first appearance appeal to the needy
multitude," says one adviser. Mr. Barker answers,
"All England, Scotland, and much more, were not
able to utter them." "Let the rich and luxurious
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">{188}</a></span>
be first addressed," say the old traditional believers
that dearness and excellence are synonymous.
Mr. Barker answers—"Print but a few of each
volume, at exceedingly high prices, and there is
more danger of ruin than gain."</p>

<p>The Note of Christopher Barker to Lord Burghley
is an answer to a complaint that had been made
in 1582, that the privileges granted to members of the
Stationers' Company "will be the overthrow of the
printers and stationers within this city, being in
number one hundred and seventy-five, and thereby
the excessive prices of books prejudiciable to the
state of the whole realm." In the absence of any
knowledge of the numbers printed of a book, and
of its consequent price, at the time of this complaint
against the monopolists of charging "excessive
prices," it may enable us to form some estimate of
the character of the books issued in 1582, and
thence of the quality of the readers of books, if we
glance at two other sources of information—Ames
and Herbert's 'Typographical Antiquities,' and
Mr. Collier's 'Extracts from the Registers of the
Stationers' Company.' The latter is especially
valuable, as showing what was doing in the most
popular literature—the literature of ballads and
broadsides, of marvellous adventures and merry
tales—which matters Ames and Herbert rejected
in a great degree.</p>

<p>In the twenty-fifth year of Queen Elizabeth
then, we learn that the printers of London had a
good deal of work to do, in the production of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">{189}</a></span>
Bibles, Testaments, and Prayer-books—of A B C's,
Primers, and Catechisms; of divinity, chiefly controversial;
of almanacs and prognostications; of
Latin books for grammar-schools; of grammars
and dictionaries; of statutes and law-books. This
was the staple work of the press, which had been
going on from the beginning of the century, and
constantly increasing. We learn from the 'Privy-purse
Accounts of Elizabeth of York,' that, in 1505,
twenty pence were paid for a Primer and a Psalter.
This sum was equal to a week's wages of a labourer
in husbandry. The Primer and the Psalter were
scarcely for the labourer. In 1516 'Fitzherbert's
Grand Abridgment,' then first published, cost the
lawyer forty shillings—a price equal to the expense
of a week's commons for all the students of Fitzherbert's
inn. No doubt a century of printing in
England had greatly lowered the price of all books
that were essential instruments in the learned professions,
or for the conduct of school education.
But in the reign of Elizabeth the class of general
readers had arisen; a class far more extensive than
that of the clerks and noble gentlemen to whom
our first printers addressed their translations of the
classics, their French and Italian romances, their
'Gesta Romanorum,' their old chronicles, and their
early poetry. It was a time of travel and adventure.
In this year, 1582, we find printed 'Discovery
and Conquest of the East Indies,' 'Discovery
and Conquest of the Provinces of Peru, and also of
the rich Mines of Potosi,' 'Divers Voyages touching
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">{190}</a></span>
the Discovery of America' (Hakluyt), 'Acts and
Gests of the Spaniards in the West Indies,' 'State
of Flanders and Portugal.' 'A Discourse in commendation
of Sir Francis Drake' had appeared in
1581. Frobisher had received his poetical 'Welcome
Home,' by Churchyard, in 1579. Of historical works,
we have none printed in 1582, with the exception
of 'The Life, Acts, and Death of the most noble,
valiant, and renowned Prince Arthur,' which the
readers of all classes would receive with undoubting
mind as an authentic record. But solid books of
history had very recently been produced. Holinshed
had published his 'Chronicles;' Guicciardini had
been translated by Jeffrey Fenton, and Herodotus
by B. R.</p>

<p>The rude historical Drama was then just arising
to familiarise the people with their country's annals.
In ten more years the press would teem with play-books;
for the triumphant era was approaching of
those who, in 1579, Stephen Gosson denounced
to uttermost perdition in his 'Pleasant invective
against poets, pipers, jesters, and such-like caterpillars
of a commonwealth.' That species of popular
literature is almost absent from the Registers of
1582; but the materials upon which much of the
romantic drama is founded were familiar to the
readers of this period. Who were the readers, we may
judge from the titles of some of these novels. One
will indicate a class:—'The Wonderful Adventures
of Simonides, gathered as well for the instruction
of our noble young gentlemen as our honourable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">{191}</a></span>
courtly ladies.' The translators and writers of
these romances seem to have had no notion of a
class of readers beyond the circle of the rich and
the high-born. Sidney's 'Arcadia' is called 'The
Countess of Pembroke's Arcadia;' and in his Dedication
to "My dear Lady and Sister," he says, "It
is done only for you, and to you; ... for indeed
for severer eyes it is not, being but a trifle, and
that triflingly handled." A few years after came
Robert Greene, and other writers of imagination,
who were equally starved in writing plays for
the stage-managers and stories for the stationers.
Greene's 'Pandosto,' afterwards called 'Dorastus
and Fawnia,' is a small quarto of 56 pages, in which
Shakspere found the story of 'The Winter's Tale.'
The author describes this novelet as "pleasant for
age to avoid dreary thoughts; profitable for youth
to eschew other wanton pastimes; and bringing to
both a desired content." He dedicates it "To the
Gentlemen Readers, Health;" and to these "Gentlemen"
he says, "If any condemn my rashness for
troubling your ears with so many unlearned pamphlets,
I will straight shroud myself under the
shadow of your courtesies." The scholar was addressing
the "gentlemen" of the Inns of Court and
of the Universities. He was looking to a ruder
class of readers when, in 1591, he published 'A
Notable Discovery of Cosenage,' having himself, as
he confesses, kept villainous company. This tract
he addresses "To the young Gentlemen, Merchants,
Apprentices, Farmers, and plain Countrymen."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">{192}</a></span>
Here is a great extension of the reading public:
but we have some doubts if Greene's tract ever
reached "Farmers and plain Countrymen." The
question arises, how were books to be circulated in
the provinces? It was more than a century later
before some of the largest towns, such as Birmingham,
had their booksellers. The pedlers who kept
the fairs and markets were the booksellers of the
early days of the press. The last new pamphlet
travelled into the country in the same pack with
the last new ruff; it travelled many miles, and
found few buyers. And yet for some popular books
the demand was not contemptible. Sir Thomas
Challoner translated 'The Praise of Folly,' of
Erasmus, which was published in 1577; and the
Stationers' Company stipulated with the publisher
that he should print "not above 1500 of any impression,"
and that "any of the Company may lay
on with him, reasonably, at every impression." Mr.
Collier, who gives this curious extract from "the
Stationers' Registers," thinks that this meant "sharing
the profits." It meant that whilst the sheets
were at press any member of the Company might
print off a reasonable number for his own sale. To
"lay on" is still a technical term in printing. Challoner's
Erasmus was an amusing book for the
scholar, and had, no doubt, a special sale amongst
teachers and students. Philip Stubbes, in his
'Anatomy of Abuses,' first published in 1583, bitterly
complains that "pamphlets of toys and babbleries
corrupt men's minds and pervert good wits;"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">{193}</a></span>
and he especially laments that such books, being
"better esteemed and more vendible than the godliest
and sagest books that be," have caused "that
worthy Book of Martyrs, made by that famous
father and excellent instrument in God his Church,
Master John Foxe, so little to be accepted." We
might have concluded that, even in those days of
limited bookselling, the great popular book of the
'Acts and Monuments' would have had an universal
sale, with its wonderful woodcuts and its deep interest
for the bulk of the people. But when its
excitement was simply historical, two centuries
afterwards, the same book would be found in many
a peasant's cottage, for the sole reason that it might
be purchased in small portions by a periodical outlay.
Whilst the wares of worthy John Fox were
sleeping in the bookseller's warehouse, the people
were buying their 'Almanacs and Prognostications,'
which Christopher Barker, speaking of their patentee,
calls "a pretty commodity towards an honest
man's living." They were buying, in this year of
1582, 'The Dial of Destiny,' an astrological treatise;
'The Examination and Confession of Witches;'
'The Execution of Edmund Campion, the Jesuit;'
'The Interpretation of Dreams;' 'A Treatise of
the rare and strange Wonders seen in the Air.'
They were buying 'A Ballad of the Lamentation of
a modest Maiden being deceitfully forsaken;' A
Ballad entitled 'Now we go, of the Papists' new
overthrow;' 'The picture of two pernicious Varlets,
called Prig Pickthank and Clem Clawback;' 'A
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">{194}</a></span>
Ballad entitled a doleful Ditty, declaring the unfortunate
hap of two faithful friends, the one went
out of her wits and the other for sorrow died.'
They were buying story-books in prose and rhyme,—accounts
of murders and treasons, of fires and
earthquakes,—and songs, "old and plain." The
Court had its 'Euphues, very pleasant for all gentlemen
to read;' and the City its mirror of Court
manners, entitled 'How a young gentleman may
behave himself in all companies.'</p>

<p>If we look very broadly at the character of the
popular literature of the middle period of the reign
of Elizabeth, and compare it with the popular
literature of our own day, we shall find that the
differences are more in degree than in kind. We
have purposely selected the period before the uprising
of our great dramatic literature, which must
have had a prodigious effect upon the intellectual
condition of the people. There was a great deal of
training going forward in the grammar-schools for
the sons of tradesmen, and of the more opulent
cultivators; but the rudiments of knowledge were
not accessible to the labourers in rural districts,
and the inferior handicraftsmen. There was, probably,
no great distinction in the acquirements of
the gentry and the burgesses. Some read with a
real desire for information; some for mere amusement.
Newspapers were not as yet. In the
country house where reading was an occupation,
there was Hall's 'Chronicle,' and Stow's 'Chronicle,'
and, may be, his rival Grafton's; there was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">{195}</a></span>
Painter's 'Palace of Pleasure,' Tusser's 'Five Hundred
Points of good Husbandry,' and, though
Philip Stubbes denies its popularity, Fox's 'Book
of Martyrs.' Chaucer and Gower had become obsolete
in the courtly circles; but Surrey, and Sackville,
and Gascoigne were dozed over after the
noontide dinner. The peers and commoners who
came to Court and Parliament bought the new
Travels and Discoveries, and carried them into the
country, for the solace of many a long winter evening's
curiosity about "antres vast and deserts idle."
The Greek and Roman classics were becoming
somewhat popularly known through translations.
But it is tolerably clear that much of the light
reading, and most of the cheapest books, were rubbish
spun over and over again out of the novels of
Bandello, and Boccaccio, and Boisteau, and losing
their original elegance in hasty and imperfect
translations. The taste for such reading received
its best counteraction when the stage became a
noble instrument of popular instruction; and when
those who did not frequent the theatres had a wondrous
store of exciting fiction opened to them by a
few plays of Shakspere and many more of his contemporaries.
It was in vain that puritanism, such
as that of Prynne, denounced "the ordinary reading
of Comedies, Tragedies, Arcadias, Amorous
Histories, Poets," as unlawful. They held their
empire till civil war came to put an end to most
home-studies, except that of party and polemical
pamphlets. But even in the tempestuous times
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">{196}</a></span>
that preceded the great outbreak, Sir Henry Wotton,
quoting the saying of a Frenchman, laments
that "his country was much the worse by old men
studying the venom of policy, and young men
reading the dregs of fancy."</p>

<p class="nodent"><span class="smc">In</span>
a condition of society which may be characterised
as that of a very imperfect civilisation—when
communication is difficult, and in some cases impossible;
when the influence of the capital upon
the provinces is very partial and uncertain; when
knowledge is for the most part confined to the
learned professions—we must regard the rich upper
classes precisely in the same relation to popular
literature as we now regard the poor lower classes.
We must view them as essentially uncritical and
unrefined, swallowing the coarsest intellectual food
with greediness, looking chiefly to excitement and
amusement in books, and not very willingly elevating
themselves to mental improvement as a
great duty. When Ben Jonson speaks of the
"prerogative the vulgar have to lose their judgments,
and like that which is naught"—when he
derides the taste of "the beast the multitude"—he
also takes care to tell us that his description of
those who "think rude things greater than polished,"
not only applied to "the sordid multitude, but to
the neater sort of our gallants: for all are the multitude;
only they differ in clothes, not in judgment
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">{198}</a></span>
or understanding."<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_19" id="Ref_19" href="#Foot_19">[19]</a></span>
About the time when Jonson wrote thus—more calmly than when he denounced
"the loathed stage, and the more loathsome age"—Burton
was exhibiting the intellectual condition of
the gentry in his 'Anatomy of Melancholy:'—"I
am not ignorant how barbarously and basely for the
most part our ruder gentry esteem of libraries and
books; how they neglect and contemn so great a
treasure, so inestimable a benefit, as Æsop's cock
did the jewel he found in the dunghill; and all
through error, ignorance, and want of education."
Again, he says, "If they read a book at any time,
'tis an English chronicle, St. Huon of Bordeaux,
Amadis de Gaul, &amp;c., a play-book, or some pamphlet
of news; and that at such seasons only when
they cannot stir abroad." The "pamphlet of news"
was a prodigious ingredient in the queer cauldron
of popular literature for the next half-century.
Every one has heard of the thirty thousand tracts
in the British Museum, forming two thousand
volumes, all published between 1640 and 1660.
The impression of many of these was probably very
small; for Rushworth, to whom they became authorities,
tells us that King Charles I. gave ten
pounds for the liberty to read one at the owner's
house in St. Paul's Churchyard. This was the
twenty years' work of Milton's "pens and heads,
sitting by their studious lamps, musing, searching,
revolving new notions and ideas." Others were,
"as fast reading, trying all things." Milton asks,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">{199}</a></span>
"What could a man require more from a nation so
pliant and so prone to seek after knowledge?" He
truly answers: "wise and faithful labourers, to
make a knowing people, a nation of prophets, sages,
and worthies."<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_20" id="Ref_20" href="#Foot_20">[20]</a></span>
The "wise and faithful labourers" were scarcely to be found in the civil
and ecclesiastical violence of these partisan writers. But they
were the pioneers of constitutional liberty; and till
that fabric was built up, literature, properly so
called, would offer few things great or enduring.
The demand for books in that stormy period was,
doubtless, very limited. The belief that the
<span title="Eichôn Basilichê">Ειχὼγ Βασιλιχὴ</span>
was written by Charles I. would naturally
account for the sale of fifty editions in one year.
But from 1623 to 1664 only two editions of Shakspere
were sold; and when the Restoration came,
an act of Parliament was passed that only twenty
printers should practise their art in the kingdom.
The fact, as recorded by Evelyn, that at the fire of
London, in 1666, the booksellers who carried on
their business in the neighbourhood of St. Paul's
lost as many books, in quires, as were worth
200,000<i>l.</i>, is rather a proof of a slow demand than
of the enormous extent of bookselling. In the
vaults of Saint Faith's were rotting many a copy
of what the world has agreed to call "heavy" books;
books in advance of their time; books that no
price would have made largely saleable—the books
for the few.</p>

<p>The terrible quarter of a century that had preceded
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">{200}</a></span>
the Restoration, and the new tastes which
the return of the Stuarts brought to England,
would seem to have swept away even the remembrances
of the popular literature of Elizabeth and
James. Edward Phillips, the nephew of Milton,
has a remarkable passage with reference to the
poets: "As for the antiquated and fallen into obscurity
from their former credit and reputation,
they are for the most part those who have written
beyond the verge of the present age; for let us
look back as far as about thirty or forty years, and
we shall find a profound silence of the poets beyond
that time, except of some few dramatics, of whose
real worth the interest of the now flourishing stage
cannot but be sensible."<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_21" id="Ref_21" href="#Foot_21">[21]</a></span>
This was written in 1674. What had the people to read who had forgotten
Spenser, and Daniel, and Drayton; and
Herbert—who knew little of Shakspere, except
in the translations of Davenant and Dryden; and
who, unquestionably, had small relish for the
popular prose of another age, such as Bacon's
'Essays'? They had rhyming tragedies; they had
obscene comedies; they had their Sedleys and
Rochesters. It is not wonderful that the popular
taste soon grew corrupted. Pepys says (1666),
"To Deptford by water, reading Othello, Moor of
Venice, which I ever heretofore esteemed a mighty
good play; but having so lately read The Adventures
of Five Hours, it seems a mean thing." Their
"light reading" was a marvel—that romance literature
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">{201}</a></span>
which at one time was as popular in its degree
as the shilling novel of our own day. We have
before us Mr. Samuel Speed's Catalogue of Books,
printed for him in 1670. The first is 'Pharamond,
the famed Romance, written by the author of those
other two eminent volumes Cassandra and Cleopatra.'
These famed and eminent volumes are large
folios, translated from the French of M. de la Calprenede.
If Calprenede was the Dumas, Madeleine
Scudery was the Eugene Sue of those days.
No popularity that these moderns have obtained
by their <i>feuilletons</i> could have exceeded the excitement
produced here, as well as in France, by
the wonderful folios of their predecessors. 'Artamenes'
and 'Clelia,' to say nothing of 'Almahide'
and 'The Illustrious Bassa,' were in every mansion
of the ladies of quality. The matron and her
daughters sate at their embroidery while the companion
read aloud, night after night, a page or two
of these interminable adventures, in which Greeks
and Romans talked the language of the <i>Grand
Monarque</i>; and the intrigues of the court, and the
characters of its personages, were mysteriously
shadowed forth in what were called "<i>Portraits</i>."
What signified that they were stupid? They were
as level to the comprehension of their high-born
readers as the penny novels of the present day are
to the intelligence of the factory-girl. They had
a long popularity, and were reprinted again and
again, in their eight or ten volumes, when the age
of duodecimos had arrived. They had been fashionable,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">{202}</a></span>
and that was enough. Character they
had none, and very little of human passions. They
were constructed upon the admirable recipe of
Molière in the 'Précieuses Ridicules'—a lover
without feeling; a mistress without preference;
mutual insensibility; sedulous attention to forms;
a declaration in a garden; the banishment of the
lover by the coquetting fair; perseverance; timid
confessions; rivals; persecutions of fathers; jealousies
conceived under false appearances; laments;
despairs; abductions; and all that. Mammas
thought they were wisely instructing their daughters,
when they permitted Mademoiselle Scudery
to teach them "des règles dont, en bonne galanterie,
on ne saurait se dispenser." In vain Molière,
and Boileau, and Scarron laughed at the great
heroic romances. They held their own till Le
Sage in France, and Defoe and Fielding in England,
spoke the language of real life. They show
us how long the great and little vulgar will feed
upon husks, till some real fruit is offered to them.
But it is remarkable how, in the same age, works
of real genius and works of intense dulness will
run side by side. It may be a question how far
'Don Quixote' drove out the romances of chivalry.
'Tartufe,' and 'Le Malade Imaginaire' were of the
same era as that of the wonderful productions in
which Cyrus was talking <i>galanterie</i> to Mandane
through a thousand folio pages. When Pepys
thought 'Othello' a mean thing compared with
'The Adventures of Five Hours' he also bought
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">{203}</a></span>
"Hudibras, both parts, the book now in greatest
fashion for drollery;" but he tells us his honest
mind when he says, "I cannot, I confess, see enough
where the wit lies." Voltaire had a different
standard of taste when he wrote, "I never met
with so much wit in one single book as in this."
The politics of 'Hudibras' made it "in greatest
fashion;" the wit shot over the heads of the idle,
dissipated, slavish, and corrupt courtiers who gave
it their patronage, but eventually left its author to
starve. Butler became popular in another generation;
and so did Milton. The first edition of
'Paradise Lost' sufficed for a circulation of seven
years.</p>

<p>The earliest Catalogue of Books published in this
country contains a list of "all the books printed in
England since the dreadful fire, 1666, to the end
of Trinity term, 1680." The statistical results of
this catalogue of the productions of the press
for fourteen years have been ascertained by us.
The whole number of books printed was 3550; of
which 947 were divinity, 420 law, and 153 physic;
397 were school-books, and 253 on subjects of
geography and navigation, including maps. About
one-half of these books were single sermons and
tracts. Deducting the reprints, pamphlets, single
sermons, and maps, we have estimated that, upon an
average, 100 new books were produced in each
year.</p>

<p>About the time when this catalogue was published,
John Dunton, one of the most eccentric,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">{204}</a></span>
and perhaps therefore amusing, of the publishing
race, went into business with half a shop. He can
tell us something of the manufacture of some of
these books of the London catalogue. He says,
"Printing was now uppermost in my thoughts; and
hackney authors began to ply me with specimens
as earnestly, and with as much passion and concern,
as the watermen do passengers with oars and scullers."
He adds, "As for their honesty, 'tis very
remarkable. They'll either persuade you to go
upon another man's copy, to steal his thought, or
to abridge his books which should, have got him
bread for his lifetime."<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_22" id="Ref_22" href="#Foot_22">[22]</a></span>
There were varieties of this class:—"Mr. Bradshaw was the best accomplished
hackney author I have met with; his
genius was quite above the common size, and his
style was incomparably fine." Dunton had a suspicion
that Bradshaw wrote 'The Turkish Spy,'
which might justify somewhat of his eulogium.
Roger North says that "the demi-booksellers,"
who deal in "the fresh scum of the press," are such
as "crack their brains to find out selling subjects,
and keep hirelings in garrets, at hard meat, to write
and correct by the great; and so puff up an octavo
to a sufficient thickness, and there is six shillings
current for an hour and a half's reading, and perhaps
never to be read or looked upon after." The
people get these wares cheaper now. The publishers
of that day, and long afterwards, were not
very nice as to the uniform excellence of the books
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">{205}</a></span>
they issued. Dunton informs us that Mr. William
Rogers, who was the publisher of Sherlock and
Tillotson, was concerned in publishing "some
Dying Speeches." They had books for all tastes,
and carried their goods to many markets. They
were equally at home in Cheapside or at Sturbridge
fair; and the great Bernard Lintot exhibited his
"rubric posts" in his shop, and kept a booth on
the Thames when it was frozen over. Some, according
to Dunton, were "pirates and cormorants;"
others, who had "the intimate acquaintance of
several excellent pens, could never want copies."
Some were good at "projection"—the devisers of
"selling subjects;" and the talent of some "lies
at collection," which Dunton exemplifies by Mr.
Crouch, who "melted down the best of our English
histories into twelvepenny books, which are
filled with wonders, rarities, and curiosities." One,
who "printed The Flying Post, did often fill it
with stolen copies;" whilst Jacob Tonson, who paid
Dryden like a safe tradesman as he was, and made
him presents of melons and sherry, is very indignant
that the great poet charged him fifty guineas
for fourteen hundred and forty-six lines, when he
expected to have had fifteen hundred and eighteen
lines for forty guineas. Peace to their manes!
They were all doing something towards the supply
of that great want which was beginning to assert
itself somewhat extensively in their day. They
were, for the most part, rugged dealers in wares
intellectual. They had many modes of turning a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">{206}</a></span>
penny beyond the profits which they derived, as
publishers, from "the great genius" or "the eminent
hand," which each patronised. They had some
difficulties in their way as manufacturers; although
the more cautious and lucky did make fortunes.
The more limited the public, the more uncertain
the demand. They were pretty safe with their tracts,
and their abridgments, and their new comedies;
but when they had to deal with works of learning,
which were necessarily costly, they and their authors—for
the authors had often to sustain the charges
of printing—encountered serious losses. We shall
see how, as the commerce of books extended, new
measures were adopted to lessen, if not to remove,
the risk.</p>

<p>Amongst the 'Calamities of Authors' there are
many touching records of</p>

<p class="center small">"Solitude, pain of heart, distress, and poverty,"</p>

<p class="nodent">produced by printing books that met with no ready
sale. Purchas was ruined by his 'Pilgrimes;'
Castell by his 'Lexicon Heptaglotton;' Ockley by
his 'History of the Saracens;' Rushworth by his
'Historical Collections.' Bishop Kennett gave away
his 'Register and Chronicle,' saying, "The volume,
too large, brings me no profit." The remedy was
to be found in publishing by subscription. This
plan, like most other human things, was subject to
abuse; but it was founded upon a true estimate of
the peculiar risks of publishing. It is manifest
that, if a certain number of persons unite in agreement
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">{207}</a></span>
to purchase a book which is about to be
printed, the author may be at ease with regard to
the issue of the enterprise, and the subscribers ought
to receive what they want at a lower cost than
when risk enters into price. For more than half a
century nearly all the great books were published
by subscription; and the highest in literature felt
no degradation in canvassing themselves with their
"subscription receipts." It is easy to perceive,
by the subscription prices, when the work was set
on foot by an author, or his friends, simply as
a more convenient mode of obtaining or bestowing
money than begging or borrowing; and when
there was a real market value given for the commodity
offered. The scheme of levying contributions
upon subscribers was as old as the days of
Taylor, the Water Poet. He published his 'Pennilesse
Pilgrimage' in this fashion; and it seems that
he sometimes gave his books to those who were unwilling
to return his honorarium. He consoles himself
by a lampoon against his false subscribers:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse quote2">"They took a book worth twelvepence, and were bound</div>
<div class="verse">To give a crown, an angel, or a pound;</div>
<div class="verse">A noble, piece, or half-piece, what they list,—</div>
<div class="verse">They past their words, or freely set their fist."</div>
</div>

</div>
</div>

<p class="nodent">Honest John had sixteen hundred and fifty such
subscribers; but of these, seven hundred and fifty
were "bad debtors."<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_23" id="Ref_23" href="#Foot_23">[23]</a></span>
In the next century, Myles Davies has the same story to tell of the degradation
of the literary begging-letter writer. He leaves his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">{208}</a></span>
books at the great man's door; he writes letter
upon letter, "with fresh odes upon his graceship,
and an account where I lived, and what noblemen
had accepted of my present." He walks before
the "parlour-window," and "advances to address his
grace to remember the poor author." At last his
parcel of books is returned to him unopened, "with
half-a-guinea upon top of the cargo," and "with desire
to receive no more." Heaven, in its mercy, has
relieved the tribe from these heartbreaking disgraces.
There may be "the fear that kills," but
there is no longer the patron who starves. Goldsmith
has described the devices and the abasement
of the little man in the coffee-house, who "drew
out a bundle of proposals, begging me to subscribe
to a new edition he was going to give the world of
Propertius, with notes." His plans were more ingenious
and diversified than those of Myles Davies:
"I first besiege their hearts with flattery, and then
pour in my proposals at the breach. If they subscribe
readily the first time, I renew my request
to beg a dedication fee. If they let me have that,
I smite them once more for engraving their coat-of-arms
at the top." Forty years after Myles Davies,
Samuel Johnson was enduring the anxieties attendant
upon the subscription plan, although friends
stood between the author and the customer. He
writes to Burney in 1758, "I have likewise enclosed
twelve receipts (for Shakspere); not that I mean
to impose upon you the trouble of pushing them
with more importunity than may seem proper," &amp;c.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">{209}</a></span>
Long was the subscribed Shakspeare delayed; and
the proud struggling man had to bear Churchill's
malignity, as well as the reproaches of his own
sense of honour:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse quote2">"He for subscribers baits his hook,</div>
<div class="verse">And takes your cash; but where's the book?"</div>
</div>

</div>
</div>

<p class="nodent">Well might Johnson write, in more prosperous
times, "He that asks subscription soon finds that he
has enemies. All who do not encourage him, defame
him." Johnson and his publishers set no price
upon their books, as a gratuity to the author, beyond
their common market value. But great men
had gone before them, who regulated their subscription
prices by a higher estimate of the value
of their works. Steele had received a guinea an
octavo volume for the republication of 'The Tatler;'
Pope had six guineas for his six quarto volumes of
'The Iliad;'—"a sum," says Johnson, "according
to the value of money at that time, by no means inconsiderable."
The subscription to Pope's 'Shakspeare'
was also six guineas for six volumes. Johnson's
projected translation of Paul Sarpi's 'History
of the Council of Trent' was only to be charged
twopence a sheet. That seems to have been the
ordinary price of subscription books during the first
half of the eighteenth century. Du Halde's 'China,'
which appears to have required a great deal of
what "the trade" call "pushing," was advertised by
Cave at three halfpence a sheet; besides the attraction
of a complicated lottery-scheme, with marvellous
prizes. When the subscribers to a new book
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">{210}</a></span>
were served, the remaining copies were sold, generally
at superior rates. Sometimes, in the case of high-priced
works, the unsold copies lay quiet through
the mildew of a quarter of a century in the bookseller's
warehouse. At Tonson's sale, in 1767,
Pope's six-guinea Shakspeare had fallen to sixteen
shillings for the hundred and forty copies then sold
as a "remainder."<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_24" id="Ref_24" href="#Foot_24">[24]</a></span>
Many of the subscription books were remarkably profitable. The gains of Pope
upon his 'Iliad' are minutely recorded in his Life
by Johnson. Lintot paid the expense of the subscription
copies, and gave the poet two hundred
pounds a volume in addition. Lintot looked for his
remuneration to an edition in folio. The project
was knocked on the head by a reprint in Holland,
in duodecimo; which edition was clandestinely imported,
as in the recent days of French editions of
Byron and Scott. Lintot took a wise course. He
went at once to the general public with editions in
duodecimo, at half-a-crown a volume, of which he
very soon sold seven thousand five hundred copies.
But it may well be doubted if Pope would have
made five thousand three hundred pounds, if he
had originally gone, without the quarto subscription
process, to the buyers of duodecimos. Perhaps
even the duodecimos would not have sold extensively
without the reputation of the quartos. There
was no great reading public to make a fortune for
the poet out of small profits upon large sales. Some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">{211}</a></span>
may think that Pope would have been as illustrious
without the ease which this fortune gave him. It
may be so. But of one thing we are clear—that in
every age the higher rewards of authorship, reaped
by one eminent individual, are benefits to the great
body of authors; and thus that the villa at Twickenham
had a certain influence in making what the
world called "Grub-street" less despicable and more
thriving. It dissociated authorship from garrets.
Yet it is marvellous, even now, how some of the
race of attorneys and stockbrokers turn up their
eyes when they hear of a successful writer keeping
a brougham, and lament, over their claret, that such
men will be improvident.</p>

<p>In those days of subscription books there were
great contrasts of success and loss; of steady support
and capricious neglect. Conyers Middleton
made a little fortune by his 'Life of Cicero,' in
two volumes quarto, published in 1741. His suspected
heterodoxy was no bar to his success. Carte,
in 1747, printed three thousand copies of the first
volume of his 'General History of England,' for
which he had adequate support. In that unlucky
volume his Jacobitism peeped out, in a relation of
an astonishing cure for the king's-evil, produced
by the touch of the first Pretender, who, he says,
"had not at that time been crowned or anointed."
Away went the "remainder" of the three thousand
volumes to the trunk-maker, and of the subsequent
volumes only seven hundred and fifty were printed.
Whether by subscription, or by the mode of fixing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">{212}</a></span>
a published price for a general sale,—which, in the
second half of the century, was superseding the
attempt to ascertain the number of purchasers
before publication,—there was always a great
amount of caprice, or prejudice, in the unripe
public judgment of a book, which rendered its
fate very hazardous and uncertain. Hume, in
1754, published the first volume of his 'History
of England.' He says, "Mr. Millar told me that
in a twelvemonth he sold only forty-five copies of
it." Gibbon published the first volume of his
'Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire' in 1776:
"I am at a loss," he modestly tells us, "how to
describe the success of the work without betraying
the vanity of the writer. The first impression was
exhausted in a few days; a second and third
edition were scarcely adequate to the demand;
and the bookseller's property was twice invaded
by the pirates of Dublin." Thomson's 'Seasons'
was lying as waste paper in the publisher's shop,
when one Mr. Whatley purchased a copy; and his
authority in the coffee-houses brought it into
notice. Collins was not so fortunate. His 'Odes'
would not sell. He repaid the bookseller the
price he had received for the copyright, settled for
the printing, and burnt the greater part of the
impression.</p>

<p>We have put together some of these scattered
facts, to show how difficult was the publication of
books before a great general public had been
raised up to read and purchase, and how the risk
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">{213}</a></span>
of expensive works was sought to be lessened by
taking hostages against evil fortune. The subdivision
of large books into weekly or monthly
numbers was one of the expedients that was early
resorted to for attracting purchasers. Some curious
relations of the first days of number-publishing are
given in a rare pamphlet by the Rev. Thomas
Stackhouse, the author of the well-known 'History
of the Bible.' In 1732 two booksellers, Mr. Wilford
and Mr. Edlin, "when the success of some certain
things published weekly set every little bookseller's
wits to work," proposed to this poor curate of
Finchley "to write something which might be
published weekly, but what it was they knew
not." At the Castle Tavern, in Paternoster Row,
the trio deliberated upon the "something" that
was to have a run. Edlin was for a "Roman
History, brushing up Ozell's dull style, when the
old thing would still do in a weekly manner."
Wilford was for 'Family Directors.' Stackhouse
proposed the 'New History of the Bible.' Wilford
backed out; Edlin and Stackhouse quarrelled.
The divine wanted many works of commentators
and critics. The bookseller maintained "that the
chief of his subscribers lived in Southwark, Wapping,
and Ratcliff Highway; that they had no
notion of critics and commentators; that the work
would be adapted to their capacity, and therefore
the less learning in it the better." Stackhouse got
out of the hands of this encourager of letters,
found another publisher, and prospered, as well as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">{214}</a></span>
he could, upon the subscriptions to his "four
sheets of original matter for sixpence."<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_25" id="Ref_25" href="#Foot_25">[25]</a></span>
Many of the number-books were published under fictitious
names of authors; and some actual authors, clerical
and lay, lent their names to works of which they
never saw a line. One of the most accomplished
of the number-book writers was Dr. Robert Sanders,
a self-created LL.D. He produced Histories of
England, in folio and quarto, under various names.
He was the writer of the Notes to the edition of
the Bible, published in 1773, under the honoured
name of Dr. Henry Southwell. The ingenious
note-writer has told the story without reservation:—"As
I was not a clergyman, my name could not
be prefixed to it. Application was made to several
clergymen for the use of their names; and at last
Henry Southwell, LL.D., granted his." In a year
or two the indefatigable Sanders was ready with a
scheme for a larger commentary. He found a
Doctor who would lend his name for a hundred
pounds; but such a sum was out of the question.
A mere A.M. was purchased for twenty pounds;
but the affair broke down. The commentator
relates that he was told by the proprietors "they
had no further occasion for my services, and even
denied me my week's wages." We hope the
laborious Sanders was less scurvily treated by the
publishers of that immortal work of his, which has
been the glory of the number-trade even up to
this hour, namely, 'The Newgate Calendar, or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">{215}</a></span>
Malefactor's Bloody Register.' How many fortunes
have been made out of this great storehouse of
popular knowledge is of little consequence to
society. It may be of importance to consider how
many imps of fame have here studied the path to
glory. Sanders had a rival—the Rev. Mr. Villette,
ordinary of Newgate—who published the 'Annals
of Newgate, or Malefactor's Register,' &amp;c., "intended
as a beacon to warn the rising generation against
the temptations, the allurements, and the dangers
of bad company." In this title-page "the celebrated
John Sheppard," and "the equally celebrated Margaret
Caroline Rudd," are leading attractions. The
author of the 'Annals,' no doubt, prospered better
than he of the 'Calendar.'</p>

<p>Poor wretched Sanders, during the period when
he was correcting Lord Lyttleton's 'History of
Henry II.,' had "a weekly subsistence;" but in
1768 he writes, "During these six weeks I have
not tasted one whole meal of victuals at a time."<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_26" id="Ref_26" href="#Foot_26">[26]</a></span>
The original race of number-publishers had no
very exalted notion of the value of literary labour.
Their successors had no will to bestow any payment
upon literature at all, while they had the old stores
to produce and reproduce. They have now been
forced into some few attempts at originality. But the
employment of new authorship is a rare exception
to their ordinary course. When the necessity does
arise, there is always perturbation of mind. In a
moment of despair, when his press was standing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">{216}</a></span>
still for some of that manuscript which, in an
unlucky hour, he had bargained for with a living
writer, one of this fraternity exclaimed, "Give me
dead authors, they never keep you waiting for
copy!" Many good books have, however, been
produced by the early number-publishers. We
may mention Chambers' 'Cyclopædia,' Smollett's
'History of England,' and Scott's 'Bible.' Some
well-printed books are still being produced, but
the compilers help themselves freely to what others
have dearly paid for. Taken as a whole, they are
the least improved, and certainly they are the
dearest books, in the whole range of popular
literature. The system upon which they are sold
is essentially that of forcing a sale; and the necessary
cost of this forcing, called "canvassing," is
sought to be saved in the quantity of the article
"canvassed," or in the less obvious degradation of
its quality. The "canvasser" is an universal
genius, and he must be paid as men of genius
ought to be paid. He has to force off the commonest
of wares by the most ingenious of devices.
It is not the intrinsic merit of a book that is to
command a sale, but the exterior accomplishments
of the salesman. He adapts himself to every condition
of person with whom he is thrown into
contact. As in Birmingham and other great
towns there is a beggars' register, which describes
the susceptibilities of the families at whose gates
beggars call, even to the particular theological
opinions of the occupants, so the canvasser has a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">{217}</a></span>
pretty accurate account of the households within
his beat. He knows where there is the customer
in the kitchen, and the customer in the parlour.
He sometimes has a timid colloquy with the cook
in the passage; sometimes takes a glass of ale in
the servants' hall; and, when he can rely upon the
charms of his address, sends his card boldly into
the drawing-room. No refusal can prevent him in
the end leaving his number for inspection. The
system is most rife in North and Midland England;
it is not so common in the agricultural South, although
it might be an instrument of diffusing
sound knowledge amongst a scattered population.
If an effort were honestly made to publish works
really cheap, because intrinsically good, upon "the
canvassing system," that system, which has many
real advantages, might be redeemed from the disgrace
which now too often attaches to it, in the
hands of the quacks who are most flourishing in
that line.</p>

<p>The number-trade was a necessary offshoot of
that periodical literature which sprang up into importance
at the beginning of the eighteenth century,
and which, in all its ramifications, has had a
more powerful influence than that of all other
literature upon the intelligence of the great body
of the people.</p>

<p class="nodent"><span class="smc">On</span>
the 8th of February, 1696, our friend John
Dunton completed the nineteenth volume of 'The
Athenian Mercury, resolving all the most nice and
curious questions proposed by the ingenious.' This
penny tract, published twice a-week, consisted of a
single leaf. "The ingenious" ceased to question,
and "The Athenian Society," as the bookseller
called his scribes, ceased to answer, after six years
of this oracular labour. There came an irruption
of the barbarians, in the shape of "nine newspapers
every week." John proposed to resume his task
"as soon as the glut of news is a little over." The
countryman waiting for the river to roll by was not
more mistaken. In 1709 there was one daily paper
in London; twelve, three times a-week; and three,
twice a-week. Amongst those of three times a-week
was 'The Tatler,' which commenced April 12, 1709.
The early Tatlers had their regular foreign intelligence.
They were as much newspapers as 'The
Flying Post' and 'The Postboy.' But Isaac Bickerstaff,
Esq., very soon discontinued the information
which he derived from letters from the Hague and
advices from Berlin. He had something of a more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">{219}</a></span>
original character to offer his readers. The state
of popular enlightenment at this period has been
described by Johnson in his Life of Addison:—"That
general knowledge which now circulates in
common talk was in his time rarely to be found.
Men not professing learning were not ashamed of
ignorance; and in the female world any acquaintance
with books was distinguished only to be censured."
Steele and Addison had to form the taste
of the new generation that they were addressing.
They knew that there was a large class craving
amusement, who might at the same time be refined
and instructed without the pretensions of "the
budge doctors of the stoic fur." They meddled
little with politics. They left the furious discussions
about Church and State to papers with an
earnest political purpose, of which Charles Leslie,
a violent Tory, thus spoke in his 'Rehearsals:'—"The
greatest part of the people do not read books;
most of them cannot read at all: but they will
gather together about one that can read, and listen
to an Observator or Review, as I have seen them,
in the streets." The Tatler has been described as
a great success; but we may measure that success
by that of the more popular Spectator. In No. 555
of that work Steele says,—"The tax on each half-sheet
has brought into the Stamp-Office, one week
with another, above 20<i>l.</i> a-week, arising from the
single paper, notwithstanding it at first reduced it
to less than half the number that was usually printed
before the tax was laid." The tax being a halfpenny,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">{220}</a></span>
this would only show a daily circulation of
1600, and of about 3000 when it was unstamped.
But the sale in volumes, according to the same
statement, was as high as 9000 of each volume.
This fact gives us a higher notion of the popularity
of these charming papers, and of the consequent
extent of general reading, than any other circumstance
in the literary history of that period. But
even the comparatively small daily sale was of importance,
as showing that the great middle class
was beginning to seek something better than could
be found in the coarse and meagre news-sheets.
The annals of 'The Gentlemen's Society at Spalding'
record that in April, 1709, some residents
there heard of the Tatlers, and ordered them to be
sent to the coffee-house in the Abbey-yard:—"They
were accordingly had, and read there every postday,
generally aloud to the company, who could
sit and talk over the subject afterwards." The narrative
goes on to say that "in March, 1711, the
Spectator came out, which was received and read
here as the Tatler had been." Such are the beginnings
of popular knowledge. What the Tatler and
Spectator were to the gentlemen of Spalding, the
Penny Magazine and Chambers' Journal were to
many a mechanic a hundred and twenty years
after. One of this class has recorded the influence
of such works, which addressed a far larger number
than could be addressed at the beginning of the
eighteenth century:—"The Penny Magazine was
published. I borrowed the first volume, and determined
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">{221}</a></span>
to make an effort to possess myself with
the second. Accordingly, with January, 1833, I
determined to discontinue the use of sugar in my
tea, hoping that my family would not then feel the
sacrifice necessary to buy the book.... I looked as
anxiously for the issue of the monthly part as I
did for the means of getting a living."<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_27" id="Ref_27" href="#Foot_27">[27]</a></span>
It is this spirit in the great mechanical class of this country
that, in spite of some popular reading that is corrupting,
and much that is frivolous, will ultimately
raise and purify even the meanest sheet of our
cheap literature, and compel those who have the
responsibility of addressing large masses of the
people to understand that an influential portion do
feel that the acquirement of knowledge is worth
some sacrifice.</p>

<p>The 'Complete Catalogue of Modern Books,
published from the beginning of the century to
1756,' contains 5280 new works. In this Catalogue
"all pamphlets and other tracts" are excluded.
We can scarcely, therefore, compare this period, as
to the number of books published, with that of
1680. The average number of the first 57 years
of the 18th century was 93 new works each year.
At the beginning of the century, the price of a folio
or quarto volume ranged from 10<i>s.</i> to 12<i>s.</i>; an
octavo from 5<i>s.</i> to 6<i>s.</i>; and a duodecimo from
2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> to 3<i>s.</i> We have the original 'Tatler'
before us, with its curious advertisements of books,
sales by the candle, cordial elixirs, lotteries, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">{222}</a></span>
bohea tea at 24<i>s.</i> a-pound. Whitelocke's 'Memorials,'
folio, is advertised at 12<i>s.</i>; Rowe's edition
of Shakspeare, 8vo., is 5<i>s.</i> per volume; 'The Peerage
of England,' 8vo., 6<i>s.</i>; Shakspeare's Poems,
12mo., 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>; 'The Monthly Amusement,' each
number containing a complete novel, is 1<i>s.</i>; Sermons
are 2<i>d.</i> each. We learn, from other sources,
that the first edition of 'The Dunciad' was a sixpenny
pamphlet; whilst 'The Governor of Cyprus,
a Novel,' and 'The Wanton Fryar, a Novel,' were
each 12<i>s.</i> The number printed of an edition was,
no doubt, very moderate, except chiefly of books
that were associated with some great popular excitement.
Sacheverell's Trial is said to have sold
30,000; as, in a later period, 30,000 were sold of
Burke's 'Reflections on the Revolution in France.'
The old booksellers were cautious about works of
imagination when they were expected to pay handsomely
for copyright. The manuscript of 'Robinson
Crusoe' was pronounced dangerous by the whole
tribe of publishers, till one ventured upon an edition.
The demand was such that the copies could only
be supplied by dividing the work amongst several
printers. One of Defoe's numerous assailants, in
attempting to ridicule him, gives the best evidence
of his popularity: "There is not an old woman that
can go to the price of it but buys 'The Life and
Adventures,' and leaves it as a legacy with the 'Pilgrim's
Progress.'" Richardson's 'Pamela,' published
in 1741, sold five editions in one year. There are
fabulous accounts of Millar, the publisher, clearing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">{223}</a></span>
18,000<i>l.</i> by 'Tom Jones.' In those times the
Dublin pirates were as assiduous in their plunder
of English copyrights as the American publishers
have been in plundering the English, and the English
the American, in our days. Richardson was driven
wild by the publication of half 'Sir Charles Grandison'
in Ireland, in a cheap form, before a single
volume was issued in England. There was a
regular system of bribery in the English printing-offices,
through which the Dublin booksellers organised
their robberies. They sold their books
surreptitiously in England and Scotland; and
from their greater cheapness they had the command
of their own market. This system lasted
till the Union.</p>

<p>The prices of books do not appear to have much
increased at the beginning of the reign of George
III. In some cases their moderation is remarkable.
We have seen how small was the demand for the
first volume of Hume's 'History' in 1754. We
have a number of 'The Gazetteer and New Daily
Advertiser' at hand, May 9, 1764; and there we
learn, from an advertisement, what a change ten
years had produced. A new edition of the third
and fourth volumes, in quarto, is advertised at 1<i>l.</i>
5<i>s.</i>; but "the proprietor, at the desire of many
who wish to be possessed of this valuable and
esteemed history, is induced to a monthly publication,
which will not exceed eight volumes."
These volumes were 5<i>s.</i> each. It is manifest that
the bookseller had found a new class to address
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">{224}</a></span>
when he issued the monthly volumes. Hume
says, "Notwithstanding the variety of winds and
seasons to which my writings had been exposed,
they had still been making such advances that the
copy-money given me by the booksellers much
exceeded anything formerly known in England."
He had complained of the neglect of the "considerable
for rank or letters." His publisher saw
that a history with such charms of style—so freed
from tedious quotations from state-papers and statutes—so
unlike the great folios of Carte and Rapin—was
a book for a new race of readers. Coleridge
humorously enough says—"Poets and philosophers,
rendered diffident by their very number,
addressed themselves to 'learned readers;' then,
aimed to conciliate the graces of 'the candid
reader;' till, the critic still rising as the author
sank, the amateurs of literature collectively were
erected into a municipality of judges, and addressed
as 'the Town.' And now, finally, all men being
supposed to read, and all readers able to judge, the
multitudinous 'Public,' shaped into personal unity
by the magic of abstraction, sits nominal despot on
the throne of criticism."<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_28" id="Ref_28" href="#Foot_28">[28]</a></span>
There is a great truth beneath the sarcasm. The enduring patronage of
the public was beginning when Andrew Millar was
bold enough to publish Hume's History in monthly
five-shilling volumes. But there are still many
evidences that the commerce of books at that
period, and subsequently, did not contemplate the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">{225}</a></span>
existence of a large class of buyers, beyond those
who were at ease in their fortunes. In that farrago
of sense and absurdity, 'The Life of James
Lackington, the present Bookseller, Finsbury-square,
London, written by himself' (1791), there
is a remarkable disclosure of the mode in which
books were prevented being sold cheaply, after the
original demand had been satisfied:—"When first
invited to these trade-sales, I was very much surprised
to learn that it was common for such as
purchased remainders to destroy one-half or three-fourths
of such books, and to charge the full publication
price, or nearly that, for such as they kept
on hand. And there was a kind of standing order
amongst the trade that, in case any one was known
to sell articles under the publication price, such a
person was to be excluded from trade-sales—so
blind were copyright holders to their own interest."
In the same manner, it is within the memory of
many living persons that there was an invariable
high price for fish in London, because the wholesale
dealers at Billingsgate always destroyed a
portion of what came to market, if the supply were
above the average. The dealers in fish had not
recognised the existence of a class who would buy
for their suppers what the rich had not taken for
their dinners; and knew not that the stalls of
Tottenham Court Road had as many customers
ready for a low price as the shops of Charing
Cross for a high price. The fishmongers had not
discovered that the price charged to the evening
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">{226}</a></span>
customers had no effect of lowering that of the
morning. Nor had the booksellers discovered that
there were essentially two, if not more, classes of
customers for books—those who would have the
dearest and the newest, and those who were content
to wait till the gloss of novelty had passed off,
and good works became accessible to them, either
in cheaper reprints, or "remainders" reduced in
price. But books and fish have one material difference.
Good books are not impaired in value
when they are cheapened. Their character, which
has been established by the first demand, creates
a second and a larger demand. Lackington destroyed
no books that were worth saving, but sold
them as he best could. We have no quarrel with
his self-commendation when he says, "I could
almost be vain enough to assert that I have
thereby been highly instrumental in diffusing that
general desire for reading now so prevalent among
the inferior orders of society."</p>

<p>What Lackington thought "a general desire for
reading" was, nevertheless, a very limited desire.
"The inferior orders of society" who had the desire
did not comprehend many of the mechanics, and
none of the husbandry labourers. It may be
doubted whether the Magazine Literature that
the eighteenth century called forth ever went
beyond the gentry and the superior traders. Kippis
says of the magazines, "they have been the means
of diffusing a general habit of reading through the
nation." There appears to have been a sort of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">{227}</a></span>
tacit agreement amongst all who spoke of public
enlightenment in the days of George III. to put
out of view the great body of "the nation" who
paid for their bread by their weekly wages. The
magazines were certainly never addressed to this
class. But for the general book-buyers of the time,
Cave's project of 'The Gentleman's Magazine' was
a great step in popular literature. The booksellers
would not join him in what they held to be a
risk. When he had succeeded, and sold 10,000,
then they set up the rival 'London Magazine.'
Cave threw all his energy into the magazine, and
was rewarded. "He scarcely ever looked out of the
window, but with a view to its improvement," said
Johnson. 'The Gentleman's Magazine' commenced
in 1731. Then came, year after year, magazines
"as plenty as blackberries:"—'The London,' 'The
Universal,' 'The Literary,' 'The Royal,' 'The Complete,'
'The Town and Country,' 'The Ladies','
'The Westminster,' 'The European,' 'The Monthly.'
The first popular review, 'The Monthly,' was published
in 1749, and 'The Critical' in 1756. The
public were now firmly established as the real
patrons of letters. There was an end of poor
authors knocking at great men's doors with a
bundle of books. There was an end to paid
Dedications and gratulatory Odes. Johnson could
afford to launch his Dictionary without the help of
the Earl of Chesterfield. Hume became "not only
independent but opulent" through the "copy-money"
of the booksellers.</p>

<div class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">{228}</a></div>

<p>The publication of Collections of the Poets was
another proof of the extension of the reading
public. The man who first projected such a Collection
went for cheapness. In 1777 John Bell
announced an edition of 'The Poets of Great
Britain; complete from Chaucer to Churchill.'
The London booksellers, to the number of forty,
held a meeting, to resist what they considered an
invasion of their literary property—some works
within the time of the statute of Anne being
legally theirs—others their copyright by courtesy.
They resolved to combine their various interests;
and they produced that edition of the Poets, in 68
volumes, which is called Johnson's, though, according
to Malone, he never saw a line of the text.
The 'Lives,' which Johnson wrote for two hundred
guineas, will endure as a great classic work, however
deformed by hasty or prejudiced judgment.
Many of the Poets given in the series have no pretension
to be looked upon again, except as a part
of literary history, which may show how the most
feeble may attain reputation in an age of mediocrity.
The booksellers spoke contemptuously of
Bell's edition, which they called "trifling." They
boasted their superior printing; but they gave no
place in their Collection to Chaucer, Spenser, or
Donne, as Bell had done. They did not care to
direct the public taste;—they printed what they
thought would sell. The demand for such Collections
has always been one of the proofs of a
healthy condition of public intelligence; but the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">{229}</a></span>
want has not often been supplied with any judgment
beyond that of the rude commercial estimate
of the prevailing fashion in poetry. It is extremely
difficult to deal with such matters. All literary
students have a proper horror of abridgments and
analyses. They want all of an author, or none.
You can neither make Chaucer extremely popular
by an entire reprint, nor command a large sale by
partial extract. But John Bell was right, in 1777,
to risk the printing of three great early poets,
whilst the booksellers began with Waller. Here
were poets that can never be wholly obsolete. But
the rubbish called poetry that found its way, by
trade preferences, into Johnson's edition—the
inanities of the drivellers between Pope and Gray—let
not these be reproduced in our time, when
such Collections are coming again into fashion, and
showing, as they showed before, an extension of
readers.</p>

<p>The Circulating Library—what a revolution was
that in popular literature! How this new plant
appeared above the earth, where it first budded,
where it bore its early fruit—how it grew into a
great tree, like that in the old title to Lilly's
Grammar, where the apples of knowledge are being
gathered by little climbing-boys—would be difficult
to trace and to record. There it was—this great
economiser of individual outlay for books—in most
market-towns at the beginning of the century.
The universal adoption of the name is the best
proof of the common recognition of the idea. It
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">{230}</a></span>
changed the habits of the old country booksellers.
It found them other occupation than keeping a
stall in the market-place, as did their worthy forefathers.
They dealt no longer in tracts and single
sermons. It sent the chap-books into the villages.
It made the 'Seven Champions of Christendom'
and 'The Wise Masters of Greece' vulgar. It
created a new literature of fiction. It banished
'Robinson Crusoe' to the kitchen, and 'The
Arabian Nights' to the nursery. It built up great
printing-houses in Leadenhall-street; and held out
high rewards for rapid composition, at the rate of
five pounds per volume, to decayed governesses
who had seen the world, and bank-clerks of an
imaginative turn of mind. These could produce a
wilderness of Italian bandits, with unlimited wealth
and beauty, who had won the hearts of credulous
countesses, and only surrendered to the hangman
when whole armies came out to take them. These
could unveil all the mysterious luxuries of great
mansions in Grosvenor-square, or of sumptuous
hotels in Bond-street. There was ever and anon a
"bright particular star" in the Milky Way of popular
fiction. But the circulating library went on its own
course, whether the empyrean of romance were dim
or brilliant. "What have you got new?" was the
universal question put to the guardian of the treasures
of this recently-discovered world of letters.
When the bower-maid of the luxurious fair one,
who lolled upon the sofa through a long summer's
day, as Gray did when he was deep in Crébillon,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">{231}</a></span>
came to "change" the book, great sometimes was
the perplexity. It was not a difficult task to
"change," but the newness was puzzling. The lady
and the neat-handed Phillis pursued their studies
simultaneously. They did not like "poetry;" they
did not like "letters." 'Sir Charles Grandison'
was as old and as tiresome as 'Pamela.' 'Tom
Jones,' and 'Peregrine Pickle;' they wondered
why they were allowed to remain in the catalogue.
They had read 'Cœlebs in search of a Wife'—the
charming book—but they did not want it again.
Perhaps, suggested the bookseller's apprentice,
'The Monk' might do once more. And so the
circulating library went on, slow and struggling,
till, about 1814, the unlucky desire for "something
new" brought down to the little greasy collection,
whose delusive numbers of volumes ranged from
1 to 3250, a new novel, with the somewhat unpromising
title of 'Waverley, or 'tis Sixty Years
since.' At first, the lady upon the sofa, and the
counsellor of her studies, could not endure it, for it
was full of horrid Scotch. It was often "at home,"
as the phrase went, for six months of its probation;
when, somehow, it was discovered that a new book
of wonderful talent had come out of the North.
Another and another came, and in a few years
the old circulating library was ruined. The
Burneys, and Edgeworths, and Radcliffes, and
Godwins, and Holcrofts, who had mixed with
much lower company upon the librarian's shelves,
still held a place. But the Winters in London
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">{232}</a></span>
and Winters in Bath, the Midnight Bells, the
Nuns, and the Watch-Towers, retired from business.
There was then a new epoch in the circulating-library
life. The literature of travels and
memoirs timidly claimed a place by the side of the
fashionable novel, which asserted its dignity by
raising its price to a guinea and a half. The old
legitimate stupidity, which did very well before
the trade was disturbed, would no longer "circulate."
But the names of the producers of the
higher fiction were not "Legion." "Something
new" must still be had. To meet the market,
every variety of west-end authorship was experimented
upon. The number to be printed could
be calculated with tolerable exactness, according
to the reputation of the writer,—and this calculation
regulated the payment of copyright, from fifty
pounds, and five hundred printed, to the man
without a name, up to fifteen hundred pounds,
and an impression of three thousand, to "the glass
of fashion." But in this department of the commerce
of literature,—as it will be in the end with
every branch upon which the growth of popular
intelligence is operating,—the rubbish is perishable,
has perished; the good endureth.</p>

<p>The circulating library is now, in many instances,
a real instrument of popular enlightenment. Yet
in some of the smaller towns, and in watering-places
where raffles have their charm, and a musical
performance is patronised in the 'Fancy Repository,'
by "audience fit though few"—there the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">{233}</a></span>
circulating library may be studied in its ancient
brilliancy. There, are still preserved, with a paper
number on their brown leather backs, and a well-worn
bill of the terms of subscription on their
sides, those volumes, now fading into oblivion,
whence the writers of many a penny journal of
fiction are drawing and will still draw their inspiration.
Many of these relics of a past age will
live over again in shilling volumes with new
titles. The heroes and heroines will change their
names; the furniture of the apartments in which
they utter their vows of love will be modernised;
every sentence which in the slightest degree approaches
the vulgar will be softened down or
obliterated. There is a great deal yet to be done
in this way; and the metamorphosis will go on
and prosper. In the mean while the circulating
libraries, both in London and the provinces,
are supporting a higher literature of fiction than
those of the past generation; and they find
also that there are other volumes almost as
attractive as the last new novel. They are doing
the same work as the book-clubs. Both these
modes of co-operation have had the effect of
making the demand for a book that is at once
solid and attractive more certain than the old
demand by individual purchasers. The certainty
of the demand necessarily produces a gradual reduction
of price. An average demand is created,
resulting from an average of taste in those who
belong to book-societies and subscribe to circulating
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">{234}</a></span>
libraries. But these channels for the sale of new
books are not materially influenced by lowness of
price. Cheapness is greatly influential with the
private purchaser; but very many are content with
the reading of a new book, through the club or
the library, who would never buy it for their own
household. This first demand is one of the means
by which good books may be cheapened for a subsequent
large issue for the permanent home library.
In 'The Life of Lackington' there is the following
passage:—"I have been informed that, when circulating
libraries were first opened, the booksellers
were much alarmed; and their rapid increase
added to their fears, and led them to think that
the sale of books would be much diminished by
such libraries. But experience has proved that
the sale of books, so far from being diminished by
them, has been greatly promoted; as from these
repositories many thousand families have been
cheaply supplied with books, by which the taste of
reading has become much more general, and thousands
of books are purchased every year by such as
have first borrowed them at those libraries, and,
after reading, approving of them, have become
purchasers."</p>

<p>One of the first attempts, and it was a successful
one, to establish a cheap Book-Club was made by
Robert Burns. He had founded a Society at
Tarbolton, called the Bachelors' Club, which met
monthly for the purposes of discussion and conversation.
But this was a club without books; for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">{235}</a></span>
the fines levied upon the members were spent in
conviviality. Having changed his residence to
Mauchline, a similar club was established there,
but with one important alteration:—the fines were
set apart for the purchase of books, and the first
work bought was 'The Mirror,' by Henry Mackenzie.
Dr. Currie, the biographer of Burns, in
recording this fact, says, "With deference to the
Conversation Society of Mauchline, it may be
doubted whether the books which they purchased
were of a kind best adapted to promote the interest
and happiness of persons in this situation of life."
The objection of Dr. Currie was founded upon his
belief that works which cultivated "delicacy of
taste" were unfitted for those who pursued manual
occupations. He qualifies his objection, however,
by the remark, that "Every human being is a
proper judge of his own happiness, and within the
path of innocence ought to be permitted to pursue
it. Since it is the taste of the Scottish peasantry
to give a preference to works of taste and of fancy,
it may be presumed they find a superior gratification
in the perusal of such works." This truth,
timidly put by Dr. Currie, ought to be the foundation
of every attempt to provide books for all
readers. We are learning to correct the false
opinions which, for a century or two, have been
degrading the national character by lowering the
general taste. Those who maintained that taste
was the exclusive property of the rich and the
luxurious, could not take away from the humble
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">{236}</a></span>
the beauty of the rose or the fragrance of the
violet; they could not make the nightingale sing a
vulgar note to "the swink'd hedger at his supper;"
nor, speaking purely to a question of taste, did they
venture to lower the noble translation of the Bible,
which they put into the hands of the poor man, to
something which, according to the insolent formula of
those days, was "adapted to the meanest capacity."
A great deal of this has passed away. It has been
discovered that music is a fitting thing to be cultivated
by the people; the doors of galleries are
thrown open for the people to gaze upon Raffaelles
and Correggios; even cottages are built so as to
satisfy a feeling of proportion, and to make their
inmates aspire to something like decoration. All
this is progress in the right direction.</p>

<p>In the year 1825 Lord Brougham (then Mr.
Brougham), in his 'Practical Observations upon
the Education of the People,' explained a plan
which has yet been only partially acted upon.
"Book-Clubs or Reading Societies may be established
by very small numbers of contributors, and
require an inconsiderable fund. If the associates
live near one another, arrangements may be easily
made for circulating the books, so that they may
be in use every moment that any one can spare
from his work. Here, too, the rich have an opportunity
presented to them of promoting instruction
without constant interference: the gift of a few
books, as a beginning, will generally prove a sufficient
encouragement to carry on the plan by weekly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">{237}</a></span>
or monthly contributions: and, with the gift, a
scheme may be communicated to assist the contributors
in arranging the plan of their association."
Simple in its working as such a plan would appear
to be, the instances of these voluntary associations
are really few. In Scotland, Lending Libraries and
Itinerating Libraries have, in some districts, been
established successfully; but in England, Lending
Libraries are scarcely to be found, except in connexion
with schools, or under the immediate direction
of the minister of a parish or of a dissenting
congregation. In these cases, we fear, comes too
frequently into action the desire, laudable no
doubt, to promote "the interest and happiness of
persons in this situation of life." They are not
permitted to choose for themselves. The best books
of amusement are kept out of their sight; and
they contrive to get hold of the worst. The timidity
which insists upon supplying these libraries with
<i>pattern</i> books renders the libraries disagreeable,
and therefore useless.<span

<p class="nodent"><span class="smc">From</span>
the time when Hume's 'History' was published
at 5<i>s.</i> a volume, there appears to have been
a steady advance in the price of books to the end
of the century. In the eleven years from 1792 to
1802, there was an average publication of 372 new
books per year. The number of new books had
quadrupled upon the average of those published from
1701 to 1756. But the duodecimo had been increased
in price from 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> to 4<i>s.</i>; the octavo from
5<i>s.</i> or 6<i>s.</i> to 10<i>s.</i>; the quarto from 12<i>s.</i> to 1<i>l.</i> 1<i>s.</i>
From 1800 to 1827 there were published, according
to the London Catalogue, 19,860 books, including
reprints; for which reprints deducting one-fifth,
there were 15,888 new books, being an annual average
of 588. Books were still rising in price. The
duodecimo mounted up to 6<i>s.</i>, or became a small
octavo at 10<i>s.</i> 6<i>d</i>.; the octavo was raised from
10<i>s</i>. to 12<i>s.</i>. or 14<i>s.</i>; the quarto was very frequently
two guineas. Some of this rise of price was unquestionably
due to the general rise in the value
of labour, and to the higher price of paper. But
more is to be ascribed to the determination of the
great publishers not sufficiently to open their eyes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">{239}</a></span>
to the extension of the number of readers, and the
absolute certainty, therefore, that a system of extravagantly
high prices was an unnatural, bigoted,
and unprofitable system. They paid most liberally
for copyright, and they looked only to an exclusive
sale for their remuneration. They did not apply
the same system to periodical works. The two
great Reviews, the 'Edinburgh' and the 'Quarterly,'
were as cheap, if not cheaper, having regard
to their literary merit, than the cheapest books of
the previous century. They were certain of their
profit through that union of excellence and cheapness
which could not fail to create a large demand.
The publishers generally had not the same reliance
upon the increase of readers of other popular works
of original excellence. It has only been within the
last twenty years that their unalloyed confidence
in a narrow market has been first shaken, and then
overthrown.</p>

<p>In looking back upon the changes of a quarter
of a century, it is impossible, even for the writer,
who was identified with this great movement in
Popular Literature, to forbear speaking of what was
accomplished by 'The Society for the Diffusion of
Useful Knowledge.' One who has written contemporary
history in a broad and liberal spirit
says—"The institution of this Society was an
important feature of its times, and one of the
honours belonging to the reign of George IV. It
did not succeed in all its professed objects: it did
not give to the operative classes of Great Britain a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">{240}</a></span>
library of the elements of all sciences—it omitted
some of the most important of the sciences, and,
with regard to some others, presented anything
rather than the elements. It did not fully penetrate
the masses that most needed aid. But it
established the principle and precedent of cheap
publication (cheapness including goodness), stimulated
the demand for sound information, and the
power and inclination to supply that demand; and
marked a great æra in the history of popular enlightenment."<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_30" id="Ref_30" href="#Foot_30">[30]</a></span>
The Society originated with Mr.
Brougham, in 1826. He gathered around him
some of the leading statesmen, lawyers, and philanthropists
of his day. Men eminent in letters
and in science joined the association. And yet its
success was so doubtful in the eyes of those who
had been accustomed to consider high price as a
necessary condition of excellence, that one of the
greatest publishing houses refused to bring out the
treatises without a guarantee. The Society wisely
went upon the principle, originally, of leaving all
the trade arrangements to its publishers. It placed
its 'Library of Useful Knowledge,' its 'Farmer's
Series,' its 'Maps,' in the hands of Messrs. Baldwin,
paying the literary and artistical expenses, and
receiving a rent upon the copies sold. Mr. Knight
originated the 'British Almanac' and its 'Companion,'
'The Library of Entertaining Knowledge,'
'The Penny Magazine,' and 'The Penny Cyclopædia;'
and he bore the entire expense and risk of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">{241}</a></span>
these works, as he did also for 'The Gallery of
Portraits,' and 'The Journal of Education,' paying
upon all a rent when the sale reached a certain
number of copies.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_31" id="Ref_31" href="#Foot_31">[31]</a></span>
It is sufficient to mention
these facts to show that the operations connected
with this Society were not upon an insignificant
scale, or not fruitful of large results; and that they
were essentially commercial operations. The cry
that was raised against this Society, by those who
were interested in the publication of dear books,
was that of "monopoly." That cuckoo cry was
repeated on every side. Fashionable publishers
shouted it; the old conventional school of authors
echoed it. Those who wrote for the Society were
called, in derision, "compilers." Scribblers who
never verified a quotation ridiculed patient industry
as dulness.</p>

<p>From the time when the Society commenced a
real "superintendence" of works for the people—when
it assisted, by diligent revision and friendly
inquiry, the services of its editors—the old vague
generalities of popular knowledge were exploded;
and the scissars-and-paste school of authorship had
to seek for other occupations than Paternoster-row
could once furnish. Accuracy was forced upon
elementary books as the rule and not the exception.
Books professedly "entertaining" were to
be founded upon exact information, and their
authorities invariably indicated. No doubt this
superintendence in some degree interfered with the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">{242}</a></span>
free course of original composition, and imparted
somewhat of the utilitarian character to everything
produced. But it was the only course by which a
new aspect could be given to cheap literature, by
showing that the great principles of excellence
were common to all books, whether for the learned
or the uninformed. In seventeen years the Society
accomplished its main objects. There were considerable
gains connected with it, and there were
great losses. These are evanescent. The good
which it did remains. It supplied the new demand
for knowledge in a way that had never before been
contemplated; it supplied it at the cheapest rate
then possible; it broke down the distinctions between
knowledge for the few and knowledge for
the many; it created a popular taste for art; it
sent its light into the strongholds of ignorance and
superstition, by superseding, for a time, a large
amount of weekly trash, and destroying, for ever,
the astrological and indecent almanacs. But, beyond
its own productions, it raised the standard
of all popular literature. It has had worthy co-labourers
and successors. It ceased its work when
others were in the field, honestly and successfully
carrying forward what it had begun. He who
writes this will ever think it an honour that he
long worked in fellowship with Henry Brougham;
and that he was a partaker, for some years, in the
councils of an association of men more or less eminent,
whose objects were never of a selfish, partial,
or temporary nature. He has sate at those councils
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">{243}</a></span>
with five cabinet ministers, who felt most deeply
that the education of the people, in its largest
sense, was as much their business as the imposition
of taxes. Where is that spirit now?</p>

<p>The modern epoch of cheap literature may be
held to have commenced, however partially, in
1827, when Constable issued his 'Miscellany,' and
the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge
their 'Library of Useful Knowledge.' In a few
years followed 'The Library of Entertaining Knowledge,'
Mr. Murray's 'Family Library,' and Lardner's
'Cabinet Cyclopædia.' These books were
properly published under a tentative system. Not
one of them rushed to that extreme cheapness
which is indicated by quantity alone. They each
had to feel their way to a demand proportioned to
the expense of their production. That production
was necessarily expensive. The cheapness consisted
in the employment of the best writers to
produce books of original merit at a price that was
essentially low, by comparison with the ordinary
rate at which books for the few were sold. Though
Constable, in his grand style, talked of millions
of buyers, he charged his little volumes 3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>
each. He was right. The millions were not ready
to buy such books at a shilling, nor even at sixpence.
They are not ready now. 'The Library
of Useful Knowledge' was charged at the rate
of 3<i>d.</i> a sheet. Taking mere quantity of paper
and printing into account, some of the penny
journals of the present day are six times as cheap.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">{244}</a></span>
'The Library of Entertaining Knowledge' was
4<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> a volume. The copyright of each volume
ordinarily cost 200<i>l.</i>, and the woodcuts as
much, and even more. 'The Family Library,' at
5<i>s.</i>, was, no doubt, equally costly. The same costliness
applies to Lardner's 'Cyclopædia,' published
at 6<i>s.</i> In these new undertakings, conceived in a
totally different spirit from anything which had
preceded them, there were large expenses which
have been surprisingly reduced by scientific discovery
and extended competition at the present
day. There were about twenty woodcutters in
London in 1827, who were real artists, paid at
artists' prices. Woodcutting is now a manufacture.
Paper, then, paid the high rate of duty, and was 50
per cent. dearer. Steam-printing was not universal,
and was only applied to common works.
Each of these series was offered to the very numerous
body of those who, having become better
educated than the same classes in a previous generation,
were desirous of real improvement. They
had a certain success, but a variable one. Every
experiment of this sort has shown that such collections
of separate and independent works cannot
rely upon a sale as a series. They come to be
bought, each work by itself, according to its attractions
for individual purchasers. Thence all those
irregularities of sale, and consequent accumulations
of stock, which press heavily upon the profits of
those volumes which are successful. The republication
of the 'Waverley Novels' in 5<i>s.</i> volumes was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">{245}</a></span>
an exception to this rule. They constituted an
integral work. Their sale was vast, although the
total cost was 12<i>l.</i> Scott and his publisher saw
the immense field that was before them, in giving
their books to the world at a price that would
carry them into thousands of households, instead
of limiting them to the circulating libraries. They
originally appeared in seventy-four volumes, at an
aggregate cost of 34<i>l.</i> 10<i>s.</i> Had they remained in
their original form, and at their first price, those
heroic efforts which lifted a mountain of debt off
the shoulders of that great man who, perhaps,
more than all men, might have claimed the motto
which Burke said should be his—"Nitor in adversum"—those
labours which wore him out, would
not have been successful. Neither would the success
have come so soon had the later publication in
twenty-five volumes for 5<i>l.</i> been tried in the first
instance. If the 'Waverley Novels' go through
new phases of cheapness, it will be because there
is now a larger public to buy; and because the first
natural price for all works of extraordinary merit,
that of authorship, has been already paid largely
and liberally. The question of price is then mainly
reduced to a question of paper and print. But
miserable would it be for a nation whose "chiefest
glory is its authors," at a time when the nature of
that glory is properly understood, if a passion for
premature cheapness, to be measured by mere
quantity, were to possess the minds of the people,
and to be the expression of the "Vox populi."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">{246}</a></span>
There was a much larger public always ready to
purchase these enchanting fictions than have been, at
any time during the last quarter of a century, ready
for the purchase of books of information, however
agreeably presented. We doubt whether the Family
Libraries, and the Libraries of Entertaining Knowledge,
and the Cabinet Cyclopædias, would have sold
better at the time of their publication, if they had
been produced at half the original price. The experiment
was tried, when the number of readers
was largely increased, in 'Knight's Weekly Volume'—a
series published at one-third the price of Constable's
'Miscellany.' The majority of books in
that series were, for the most part, of intrinsic
merit; many also carrying the recommendation
of popular names as their authors. "Why Mr.
Knight did not profit largely by the speculation is
a problem yet to be solved," says the writer of a
recent paper on 'Literature for the People.' The
solution is, that the people did not sufficiently buy
them. So far from twenty thousand copies being
sold of many volumes, as asserted, there were not
twenty volumes, out of the hundred and forty, that
reached a sale of ten thousand, and the average sale
was scarcely five thousand. They were not cheap
enough for the humble, who looked to mere quantity.
They were too cheap for the genteel, who
were <i>then</i> taught to think that a cheap book must
necessarily be a bad book. It is impossible not to
remember that, even ten years ago, the majority of
publishers, and many of their supporters in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">{247}</a></span>
public journals, hated cheap books. The 'Weekly
Volumes' were welcomed very generally by those
who were anxious for the enlightenment of the
people. Societies were set on foot for their circulation.
But all experience has shown that no associations
for recommending books, and forcing their
sale, can be successful. The people, of every grade,
will choose for themselves. It is useless to urge an
adult, whether male or female, to buy a solid book
when an exciting one is longed for. It is worse
than useless to give books of improvement away to
the poor. They always suspect the motive. Very
wisely did a witness before the "Select Committee
on Newspaper Stamps," 1851, say, "There are
classes which you cannot reach, unless you go to
them with something which is the nearest thing to
what they want." If they want fiction, they will
not look at science or history. At the time of the
issue of 'The Weekly Volume,' the sale of books at
railway stations was unknown; and if it had been
known, they scarcely presented sufficient attractions
for the travelling readers for amusement. They
were published also in too quick succession. It was
a plausible theory of the editor, that, if good books,
extremely cheap, were issued rapidly enough to
form a little library, many such libraries would be
formed. Those who have to deal with 'Literature
for the People' must bear in mind that time as
well as money has to be economised by those who
of necessity must labour hard either by hand or
head. What may be called furniture books may
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">{248}</a></span>
be bought by the luxurious, to put upon their
shelves, and looked at when wanted. The earnest
workers buy few books that they are not desirous
to read, and to read at once. They bought such a
book in 1830, to the extent of 50,000 copies. 'The
Results of Machinery,' written by the author of
this volume, was addressed to great human interests.
It was not professedly amusing; but it was
the first attempt to take Political Economy out of
its hard and logical track. It is now recorded, as
a wonderful instance of the application of cheapness
to a dry subject, that Mr. M'Culloch's 'Essay on
the Rate of Wages,' is republished at a shilling.
It is in no spirit of self-laudation that we presume
to think that the vaunted cheapness of 1854 had
some previous examples.</p>

<p>In this principle, that the great mass of the
people will read as they buy, lies the secret of the
enormous success of the weekly sheets of that great
epoch of cheapness which began about twenty years
ago. It is the principle which is the foundation of
the extensive demand, growing year by year, for
all periodical literature. It made the essayists.
It made the magazines. It made the newspapers.
It caused a sale of three hundred thousand weekly
sheets in 1834. It is causing a sale of fourteen
hundred thousand weekly sheets in 1854. Before
we proceed in the examination of this remarkable
epoch of popular literature, let us glance at the influence
of mechanical and scientific improvement
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">{249}</a></span>
on the cheapening of books during the last thirty
or forty years.</p>

<p>Those who have followed us in our notices of
the early history of printing will scarcely have
failed to see how the ordinary laws of demand and
supply have regulated the progress of this art,
whose productions might, at first sight, appear to
form an exception to other productions required by
the necessities of mankind. There can be little
doubt, we think, that when several ingenious men
were, at the same moment, applying their skill to
the discovery or perfection of a rapid mode of
multiplying copies of books, there was a demand
for books which could not well be supplied by the
existing process of writing. That demand had
doubtless been created by the anxiety to think for
themselves which had sprung up amongst the
laity of Catholic Europe. There was a very
general desire amongst the wealthier classes to
obtain a knowledge of the principles of their
religion from the fountain-head,—the Bible. The
desire could not be gratified except at an enormous
cost. Printing was at last discovered; and Bibles
were produced without limitation of number. The
instant, therefore, that the demand for Bibles
could be supplied, the supply acted upon the
demand, by increasing it in every direction; and
when it was found that not only Bibles but many
other books of real value, such as copies of the
ancient classics, could be produced with a facility
equal to the wants of every purchaser, books at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">{250}</a></span>
once became a large branch of commerce, and the
presses of the first printers never lacked employment.
The purchasers of books, however, in the
fifteenth and sixteenth centuries were almost
wholly confined to the class of nobles and those
of the richer citizens and scholars by profession.
It was a very long time before the influence of
the press had produced any direct effect upon the
habits of the great mass of the people. It was not
till the system of periodical literature was fairly
established, and that newspapers first, and magazines
and reviews subsequently, had taken hold
of the popular mind, that the productions of the
press could be said to be in demand amongst the
people generally. Up to our own times that
demand has been limited to very narrow bounds;
and the circumstances by which it has been extended
are as remarkable as those which accompanied
the progress of the original invention of
printing. The same principle of demand going
before supply, and the same reaction of supply
upon demand, will be found to have marked the
operations of the printing-press in this country,
during the last twenty-five years, as distinctly as
they marked them throughout Europe in the latter
part of the fifteenth century and the beginning of
the sixteenth. We will shortly recapitulate these
circumstances.</p>

<p>A few years after the commencement of the
present century, a system of education, which is
now known throughout Europe as that of <i>mutual</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">{251}</a></span>
<i>instruction</i>, was introduced into this country. In
whatever mode this system was called into action,
its first experiments soon demonstrated that,
through it, education might be bestowed at a
much cheaper rate than had ever before been
considered practicable. This success encouraged
the friends of education to exertions quite unexampled;
and the British and Foreign School
Society, and the National Society, had, in a very
few years, taught some thousands of children to
read and write, who, without the new arrangements
which had been brought into practice,
would in great part have remained completely
untaught. A demand for books of a new class
was thus preparing on every side. The demand
would not be very sudden or very urgent; but it
would still exist, and would become stronger and
stronger till a supply was in some degree provided
for it It would act, too, indirectly but surely,
upon that portion of society whose demand for
knowledge had already been in part supplied. The
principle of educating the humblest in the scale of
society would necessarily give an impulse to the
education of the class immediately above them.
The impulse would indeed be least felt by the
large establishments for education at the other
end of the scale; and thus, whilst the children
of the peasant and the tradesman would learn
many valuable lessons through the influence of a
desire for knowledge for its own sake, and of love
for their instructors, many of the boys of our great
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">{252}</a></span>
public schools would long remain acquiring only a
knowledge of words and not of things, and influenced
chiefly by a degrading fear of brutal
punishment. The demand for knowledge thus
created, and daily gathering strength amongst the
bulk of the people, could not be adequately supplied
forty years ago by the mechanical inventions then
employed in the art of printing. Exactly in the
same way as the demand for knowledge which
began to agitate men's minds about the middle of
the fifteenth century produced the invention of
printing, so the great extension of the demand in
England, at the beginning of the nineteenth century,
produced those mechanical improvements
which have created a new æra in the typographical
art. These improvements consist in the process
of stereotyping, and in the printing-machine, as
distinguished from the printing-press.</p>

<p>As several approaches had been made before the
time of Faust to the principle of printing books
from moveable types, so the principle of producing
impressions from a cylinder, and of inking the
types by a roller, which are the great principles of
the printing-machine, had been discovered in this
country as early as the year 1790. In that year
Mr. William Nicholson took out a patent for certain
improvements in printing, the specification of
which clearly shows that to him belongs the first
suggestion of printing from cylinders. But this
inventor, like many other ingenious men, was led
astray by a part of his project, which was highly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">{253}</a></span>
difficult, if not impracticable, to the neglect of that
portion of his plan which, since his time, has been
brought into the most perfect operation. Nicholson's
patent was never acted upon. The first
maker of a printing-machine was Mr. Koenig, a
native of Saxony; and the first sheet of paper
printed by cylinders, and by steam, was the 'Times'
newspaper of the 28th November, 1814. The
machine thus for the first time brought into action
was that of Mr. Koenig. It has been superseded
by machines of improved construction.</p>

<p>Let us imagine a state of things in which the
demand for works of large numbers should have
gone on increasing, while the mechanical means of
supplying that demand had remained stationary—had
remained as they were at the beginning of the
present century. Before the invention of stereotyping
it was necessary to print off considerable
impressions of the few books in general demand,
such as bibles and prayer-books, that the cost of
composition might be so far divided as to allow the
book to be sold cheap: with several school-books,
also, it was not uncommon to go to press with an
edition of 10,000 copies. Two men, working eight
hours a-day each, would produce 1000 perfect impressions
(impressions on each side) of a sheet per
day; and thus, if a book consisted of twenty sheets
(the size of an ordinary school-book), one press
would produce the twenty sheets in 200 days. If
a printer, therefore, were engaged in the production
of such a school-book, who could only devote one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">{254}</a></span>
press to the operation, it would require very nearly
three-quarters of a year to complete 10,000 copies
of that work. It is thus evident, that if the work
were to be published on a given day, it must begin
to be printed at least three-quarters of a year before
it could be published; and that there must be a considerable
outlay of capital in paper and in printing
for a long time before any return could be expected.
This advance of capital would have a necessary influence
on the price of the book, in addition to the
difference of the cost of working by hand as compared
with working by machinery; and there
probably the inconvenience of the tedious progress
we have described would stop. But take a case
which would allow no time for this long preparation.
Take a daily newspaper, for instance, of which
great part of the news must be collected, and
written, and printed within twenty-four hours;
calling into operation reporters at home, correspondents
abroad, expresses, electric telegraphs.
Formerly, the number printed of the most popular
daily paper would be limited to five thousand;
and this number could not be produced in time
without the most perfect division of labour aiding
the most intense exertion, provided that paper
were printed by hand. The 'Times' newspaper
now produces forty thousand copies in less than
four hours, from one set of types.</p>

<p>If the difficulties that existed in producing any
considerable number of newspapers before the invention
of the printing-machine were almost insurmountable,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">{255}</a></span>
equally striking will the advantages of
that invention appear when we consider its application
to the cheap weekly sheets, of which the
'Penny Magazine' was the type. Let us suppose
that the education of the people had gone on uninterruptedly
in the schools of mutual instruction,
and that the mechanical means for supplying the
demand for knowledge thus created had sustained
no improvement. If the demand for knowledge
had led to the establishment of the 'Penny Magazine'
before the improvement of printing, it is probable
that the sale of twenty thousand copies would
have been considered the utmost that could have
been calculated upon. One thousand perfect copies
could only have been daily produced at one press
by the labour of two men. The machine produces
sixteen thousand copies. If the demand for a
penny sheet, printed thus slowly by the press, had
reached twenty thousand, it would have required
two presses to produce that twenty thousand in the
same time—namely, ten days—in which one hundred
and sixty thousand are produced by the machine;
and it would have required one press to be at work
one hundred and sixty days, or sixteen presses for
ten days, to effect the same results as the machine
effects in ten days. But, in point of fact, such a
sale could never have been reached under the old
system of press-work. The hand-labour, as compared
with the machine, would have added at least
forty per cent. to the cost of production, even if the
sixteen presses could have been set in motion.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">{256}</a></span>
Without stereotyping for duplicates, no attempt
would have been made to set them in motion; for
the cost of re-engraving woodcuts, and of re-composing
the types, would have put a natural commercial
limit to the operation.</p>

<p>The invention of the paper-machine was concurrent
with the invention of the printing-machine.
Without the paper-machine, the material of books,
and newspapers, and journals, could never have
been supplied with any reference to cheapness.
Chemistry, too, has converted the coarsest rags,
and the dirtiest cotton-wool, into fine pulp. The
material of which this book is formed existed a
few month ago, perhaps, in the shape of a tattered
frock, whose shreds, exposed for years to the sun
and wind, covered the sturdy loins of the shepherd
watching his sheep on the plains of Hungary;—or
it might have formed part of the coarse blue
shirt of the Italian sailor, on board some little
trading-vessel of the Mediterranean;—or it might
have pertained to the once tidy <i>camicia</i> of the
neat straw-plaiter of Tuscany, who, on the eve of
some festival, when her head was intent upon gay
things, condemned the garment to the <i>stracci-vendolo</i>
(rag-merchant) of Leghorn;—or it might
have constituted the coarse covering of the flock-bed
of the farmer of Saxony, or once looked bright
in the damask table-cloth of the burgher of Hamburgh;—or,
lastly, it might have been swept, new
and unworn, out of the vast collection of the shreds
and patches, the fustian and buckram, of a London
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">{257}</a></span>
tailor; or might have accompanied every revolution
of a fashionable coat in the shape of lining—having
travelled from St. James's to St. Giles's,
from Bond Street to Monmouth Street, from Rag
Fair to the Dublin Liberty, till man disowned
the vesture, and the kennel-sweeper claimed its
miserable remains. In each or all of these forms,
and in hundreds more which it would be useless
to describe, this sheet of paper a short time since
might have existed. No matter, now, what the
colour of the rag—how oily the cotton—what filth
it has gathered and harboured through all its
transmutation—the scientific paper-maker can
produce out of these filthy materials one of the
most beautiful productions of manufacture. But
he has a difficulty in obtaining even these coarse
materials. The advance of a people in civilisation
has not only a tendency to make the supply of rags
abundant, but, at the same time, to increase the
demand for rags. The use of machinery in manufactures
renders clothing cheap; the cheapness of
clothing causes its consumption to increase, not
only in the proportion of an increasing population,
but by the scale of individual expenditure; the
stock of rags is therefore increasing in the same
ratio that our looms produce more linen and cotton
cloth. But then the increase of knowledge runs
in a parallel line with this increase of comforts;
and the increase of knowledge requires an increase
of books. The principle of publishing books and
tracts, to be read by thousands instead of tens and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">{258}</a></span>
hundreds, has already caused a large addition to
the demand for printing-paper. Science made
paper cheap in spite of taxation. The government
has worked against science to keep books dear.</p>

<p>We cannot pass over the mechanical and other
scientific improvements in typography, which preceded
and accompanied the great epoch of cheapness
of the last quarter of a century, without more
particularly noticing the revival, for so it may be
called, of the art of woodcutting. In the 'Penny
Magazine' of 1836, the editor says that no expense
or labour has been spared to attain every improvement
of which the art of woodcutting is susceptible—that
the engravings of 305 numbers have
cost 12,000<i>l.</i> (about 40<i>l.</i> a number)—that many
difficulties have been overcome in adapting the
character of the engravings to the rapid movements
of the printing-machine—and that the art, in connexion
with the cheapest form of printing, has
been carried further than at one time was thought
to be possible. This was written in 1836. Let any
one look at a common book with woodcuts, printed
thirty years ago, and he will understand what difficulties
had to be overcome before 'The Penny Magazine'
could present successful copies of works of
art. This 'Penny Magazine,' which some even
now affect to sneer at, produced a revolution in
popular art throughout the world. It created similar
works, to which it supplied stereotype casts, in
Germany, France, Holland, Livonia (in Russian and
German), Bohemia (in Sclavonic), Italy, Ionian
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">{259}</a></span>
Islands (in Modern Greek), Sweden, Norway,
Spanish America, the Brazils, the United States.
It raised up imitators on every side, and directed
the union of art and letters into new channels.
It was the forerunner of 'Punch,' and of 'The
Illustrated London News.' A great art-critic of
1836 proclaimed, with oracular solemnity, "As
there is no royal road to mathematics, so we say,
once for all, there is no Penny Magazine road to
the Fine Arts—the cultivation of the Fine Arts
must be carried on by a comparatively small and
gifted few, under the patronage of men of wealth
and leisure." Many eminent designers—amongst
whom are the honoured names of Harvey, Cruikshank,
Doyle, Leech, Tenniel, Anelay, Gilbert—have
gone the "Penny Magazine road," and found
it quite as sure a highway to distinction, and far
more pleasant, than the old by-way of patronage,
so weary to the gifted few. It is wonderful how
long and how tenaciously, both in literature and
art, men clung to that idol Patronage. They are
gone—the Chesterfields who kept Johnson seven
years waiting in outward rooms,—and the Mansfields
who grudged Wilkie thirty guineas for 'The
Village Politicians:'—</p>

London Catalogue of Books published in
Great Britain, 1816 to 1851,' furnishes, in its
alphabetical list, with "sizes, prices, and publishers'
names," that insight into the character and extent
of the literature of a generation which we cannot
derive from any other source. We have already
given some of the calculations of past periods. Let
us endeavour to trace what the commerce of books
has been in our own time.</p>

<p>Every book in this 'London Catalogue' occupies
a single line. There are 72 lines in a page; there
are 626 pages. It follows that the Catalogue contains
the titles of 45,072 books. In these 36
years, then, there was an average annual publication
of 1252 books. This number is more than
double the average of the period from 1800 to
1827. There is also published, by the proprietor
of 'The London Catalogue,' an Annual Catalogue
of New Books. From two of these catalogues we
derive the following comparative results for the
beginning and the end of a quarter of a century:—</p>

<p>Such calculations are not arrived at without the
labour of many hours; but the labour is not ill-bestowed
by us, for they afford better data for
opinion than loose talk about the number, quality,
and price of books. Hence we learn, that, in 1853,
there were three times as many books published as
in 1828; that the comparative increase in the
number of volumes was not so great, showing that
of the new books more single volumes were published;
that the total cost of one set of the new
publications had increased by more than one-half
of the former cost; that the average price of each
new work had been reduced nearly one-half; and
that the average price per volume had fallen about
5s. below the price of 1828. A further analysis of
this Annual List shows that, of the 2530 books
published in 1853, only 287 were published at a
guinea and upwards; and that of these only 206
were books of general information; while 28 were
law-books, and 53 of the well-accustomed dear
class of guinea-and-a-half novels. Decidedly the
Quarto Dynasty had died out.</p>

<p>As a supplement to the 'London Catalogue,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">{262}</a></span>
1816-1851,' there is published a 'Classified Index.'
Through this we are enabled to estimate in round
numbers the sort of books which the people were
buying, or reading, or neglecting, in these 36
years.<span

<p>But the Catalogues of New Books fall very
short of affording a complete view of the state of
popular literature at any given period. We must
apply to other sources of information.</p>

<p>The publication of 'The Penny Magazine,' and
of 'Chambers' Journal,' in 1832, was concurrent
with a general increase in the demand for periodical
works. At the end of 1831 there were issued 177
monthly publications, a single copy of which cost
17<i>l.</i> 12<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> At the end of 1833 there were 236
monthly periodicals, a single copy of which cost
23<i>l.</i> 3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> At the end of 1853 there were 362
of the same monthly class, a single copy of which
cost 14<i>l.</i> 17<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> In 1831 the average price of
the monthly periodicals was 2<i>s.</i>; in 1833, 1<i>s.</i> 11½<i>d.</i>;
and in 1853, 9½<i>d.</i> Can there be any doubt of the
adaptation of periodical literature, during these
years, to the wondrous extension of readers?</p>

<p>It appears from 'The London Catalogue of
Periodicals,' published by Messrs. Longman and
Co., from which we derive the calculations we have
now made, that there are 56 <i>weekly</i> periodicals.
There were 21 in 1833. But this list, which is
adapted for what is known as 'The Trade,' is far
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">{264}</a></span>
from including all the cheap sheets that are issued
weekly from the London press. There is a very
large class of such publications that are very rarely
found in the shops of regular booksellers, either in
town or country. Many of these periodicals have
the taint upon them of the names of their publishers;
and some of them a few years ago were infamous.
We do not find in the 'London Catalogue
of Periodicals' the names of several works, and of
one especially, which present the most remarkable
example in our times of the extent to which cheap
literature is offered to the people in marts which
are comparatively unknown to the upper and middle
classes. The facilities of communication have sent
an unparalleled quantity of weekly sheets through
the land, at a rate of cheapness which defies all
competition of literary quality against weight of
paper and crowding of print. In every shop of
every back-street of London and the larger towns,
where a tradesman in tobacco or lollipops or lucifer-matches
formerly grew thin upon his small amount
of daily halfpence, there now rush in the schoolboy,
the apprentice, the milliner, the factory-girl, the
clerk, and the small shopkeeper, for their 'London
Journal,' 'Family Herald,' 'Reynolds' Miscellany,'
and 'Cassell's Paper.' We have ascertained, from
sources upon which we can rely, that of these four
sheets a million copies are sold weekly. Of the
contents of these, and other cheap works, we shall
have presently to speak.</p>

<p>When we look back at the various periods of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">{265}</a></span>
English publication, and consider how amazingly
the aggregate number of books published in any
one period has increased, we must also regard the
size and price of the works published to form any
adequate notion of the progress of cheap literature.
With a general reduction of price during the last
twenty years—with the substitution of duodecimos
for quartos—and with single volumes beyond all
former precedent—there is little doubt that the
annual returns of the publishing trade, in all its
departments (we include newspapers), are double
what they were in 1833. They were estimated
then at 2,500,000<i>l.</i> We should not be wide of the
mark in considering them at present to have
reached to 5,000,000<i>l.</i> As the silk-trade is now to
be estimated, not by the number of ladies of fashion
who wear brocade on court-days, but of the millions
who buy a silk dress for ordinary use; so is the
book-trade to be estimated, not by the number of
the learned who once bought folios, and of the rich
who rejoiced in exclusive quartos, but of the many
to whom a small volume of a living author has become
a necessity for instruction or for amusement,
and who desire to read our established literature in
editions well printed and carefully edited, though
essentially cheap. This number of readers is constantly
increasing, and as constantly pressing for
a reduction of price upon modern books of high
reputation. Mr. Macaulay's 'Essays' were originally
published at 1<i>l.</i> 16<i>s.</i>; they then appeared in
one large volume at 1<i>l.</i> 1<i>s.</i> Messrs. Longman now
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">{266}</a></span>
advertise a "People's Edition," in 7 monthly parts
at 1<i>s.</i>, and in numbers at 1½<i>d.</i> They do so, they
say, "on the recommendation of correspondents
who have expressed their desire to possess them,
but who have found the existing editions beyond
their means."</p>

<p>In turning over the leaves of the London Catalogue
from 1816 to 1851, we rejoice to see how
much has been done in this direction, whatever
may be the greater amount yet to be done. Of
the Poets—Byron, Campbell, Crabbe, Coleridge,
Moore, Scott, Southey, Wordsworth, are obtainable
at the most reasonable prices, in collected editions.
The elder Poets may be had in the Aldine Series,
and in new collections, now in course of publication.
The most popular of the recent Novelists—Scott,
Dickens, D'Israeli, Lytton, Thackeray—are in
volumes whose cheapness introduces them to
many a fireside where the original editions would
find no place. Wilkinson's 'Egypt,' Alison's
'History of Europe,' the works of Chalmers, and
many extensive theological books, have been reproduced
at cheap rates. The various 'Libraries'
which have been published and are still publishing—Bohn's
Antiquarian, Classics, Classical, Ecclesiastical,
Illustrated, Scientific, and Standard; the
Library of Entertaining Knowledge; the Family
Library; the Edinburgh Cabinet Library; Lardner's
Cyclopædia; Family Classical Library; Knight's
Weekly Volumes; Jardine's Naturalist's Library;
Murray's Home and Colonial Library; Sacred
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">{267}</a></span>
Classics; Christian Family Library; Smith's
Standard Library; Tegg's Standard Library;
National Illustrated Library; Reading for the
Rail; Traveller's Library; Standard Novels;
Chambers' Miscellany of Facts; Papers for the
People; Instructive Library; Weale's Rudimentary
Series: these, the more important of the various
Collections that can be called cheap, comprise no
fewer than 1400 volumes. It would require an
enumeration which is the province of the future
bibliographer, to show how many separate books,
in every department of knowledge, have been
issued during the last twenty years, with a distinct
reference to the means of the greatest number of
readers. But the process here, as in other cases,
has necessarily been gradual. The general cheapening
of books must be gradual to be safe. The
soundings of the perilous sea of publishing must
be constantly taken. There is no chart for this
navigation which exhibits all the sunken rocks and
quicksands.</p>

<p>In addition to the Collections just enumerated,
we have the new Libraries, whether known as
Cheap Series, Parlour Library, Pocket Library,
Railway Library, or Readable Books. These are,
for the most part, devoted to novels, old and new,
and to American reprints. In this form 'Uncle
Tom's Cabin' rushed into a circulation which no
book—with the exception of the Bible and Prayer-Book,
and perhaps some Spelling-Book—ever before
attained. Here Sir Edward Bulwer Lytton is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">{268}</a></span>
to reach a popularity which no novelist ever before
reached; and to be paid "the extravagant sum of
20,000<i>l.</i> for the exclusive sale of his works for the
next ten years," as we are assured in 'The Times.'
We hear of enormous profits made, and fortunes
realised, by these books. They meet the eye on
every railway stall and in every stationer's window,
glittering in green and crimson. But we also
sometimes hear of large stocks of unsaleable
ventures, and of consequent evil-fortune, in spite
of one or two profitable undertakings. We have
great confidence in the largest sale of the cheapest
edition of an attractive book by an author of
reputation; but we have no confidence in the
large individual sale of a great number of such
distinct books, each jostling the other in the race
for popularity. We believe that the sale of many
such works has been much exaggerated. We hear
that the margin of profit, as commercial men say, is
very narrow, and leaves little surplus to cover risk.
Of one thing we are clear. Whatever sum may be
paid for a great name, the natural sale of books of
this class can afford very little for the payment of
copyright in ordinary cases. The paper, machine-work,
and binding, we are informed, of one of the
shilling volumes will cost, for an impression of
10,000, about 220<i>l.</i>, and the trade expenses and
advertising will raise that cost to 250<i>l.</i> This is
6<i>d.</i> per copy. They are sold wholesale at 8<i>s.</i> for
13 copies, which leaves a surplus of about 60<i>l.</i> But
the setting up the types and the stereotyping will
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">{269}</a></span>
cost about 40<i>l.</i> There is 20<i>l.</i> then left for the
publisher upon 10,000<i>l.</i> If he sells 20,000<i>l.</i> there
is 80<i>l.</i> Where is the fund for the payment of
authorship? Is it to be assumed that a sale of
40,000 or 50,000 copies may at present be attained
for such works under ordinary conditions? If not,
is the cheapest supply of reading for these kingdoms
to be kept up by piracies from America or
republications of expired copyrights? We doubt
if this trade generally is in a healthy position: at
any rate, we fear that we must scarcely look to this
class of books for making "Cheap Literature" what
it might be made by judicious management—an
instrument of great public good. Piracy from
American authors has been, within these few
years, chiefly confined to the shilling Railway
Volumes; and it had a great success while all the
elements that combine to produce an anti-slavery
enthusiasm were in operation. But it has lost the
charm of novelty, and the fashion of American
novels is now somewhat stale. In the mean while
the United States never relax in their course. In
Mr. Carey's 'Letters on International Copyright,'
published at Philadelphia in 1853, we have some
details of the advantage of the fraudulent cheapness
to the American public. He says, Mr. Dickens
sells 'Bleak House' in England for 21<i>s.</i> (5 dollars);
comparing the book with copyright books in America,
of which the sale is large, he would expect 3 dollars
under the international system. The number of
'Bleak House' supplied to American readers in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">{270}</a></span>
newspapers and magazines, as well as in the book
form, is not less than 250,000, at half a dollar,
giving for the whole 125,000 dollars. Mr. Dickens
would charge 750,000 dollars:—</p>

<p>This is a difference of 409,500<i>l.</i> sterling. Mr.
Carey deduces from these figures this logical consequence:
"Under the system of international
copyright, one of two things must be done: either
the people <i>must</i> be taxed in the whole of this
amount for the benefit of the various persons,
abroad and at home, who are now to be invested
with the monopoly power, or they <i>must</i> largely diminish
their purchases of literary food." He would
not have a healthy cheapness, produced in both
countries by an open commerce and a fair competition.
He would not have a cheapness produced by
the publishers of both countries reckoning upon
an extended market, and a consequent division of
the first expenses of a book. He would have a
piratical cheapness—the cheapness of the smuggler
and the illicit distiller—"for the general interests
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">{271}</a></span>
of the American people." This ingenious gentleman
has a ready defence. There is no copyright in
the facts of a book. Copyright is given for the
clothing in which the body is produced to the world.
Mr. Macaulay has contributed nothing to positive
knowledge. Mr. Dickens has gone into a large
garden, and made a bouquet of the flowers, although
he paid no wages to the man who raised
them. He who makes a book uses the common
property of mankind, and all he furnishes is the
workmanship. Mankind has, therefore, a right to
say to the authors, whenever they seek an extension
of their privileges, "Be content, my friends; do not
risk the loss of a part of what you have, in the
effort to obtain more." Mr. Carey is further obliging
enough to tell us that in England authors, with a
few brilliant exceptions, are condemned to almost
hopeless poverty, which he attributes to our system
of centralization. Why do not the wealthy people
of England give a shilling a head towards paying
for the copyright of books, instead of bringing the
poverty of authors before the world, and demanding
from other countries an extension of the monopoly
they have at home? The people of England,
through centralization, have become so poor and
wretched that there is no demand for books, and no
power to compensate the people who make them.
Authors there are badly paid and insolently treated.
Science is in no request in England, and hence the
diminution of supply. In contrast with the limited
sale of English books at home is the great extent of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">{272}</a></span>
sale here. <i>Argal</i>, let the authors starve at home;
why should we, the great American people, tax
ourselves for their aid? We give them <i>fame</i>, and
that is enough. Let not <i>our</i> writers, adds this
candid and modest gentleman, desire to barter our
great market for literature for one in which Hood
was permitted to starve, and Tennyson and others
submit to the degradation of receiving public charity
in the shape of pensions. The wretched
English authors may come and live amongst us,
and participate in our advantages. American
authorship is Belgrave Square; let it not make a
treaty with the Grub Street of England, to have a
dinner from our well-furnished tables. We think
Mr. Carey, "Author of Principles of Political
Economy," has done service by this astounding
effrontery. If he reflected the mind of the
Government or the people, we should be hopeless
of any attempt to unite England and America in
the protection of a common literature founded
upon a common language. But Mr. Carey does
not reflect this mind. He does not even speak for
the great body of American authors or publishers.
He speaks for the proprietors of the newspapers,
which, all over the Union, are filled, week by
week, by the piracy of modern English Literature,
and especially of English fiction. To keep
up this robbery, writers and orators will alike
prostitute themselves to defend, unblushingly,
what they know to be a disgrace.</p>

<p>But in one point Mr. Carey is right. He shows
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">{273}</a></span>
us, upon representations which we cannot doubt,
that the works of popular authors, citizens of the
United States, and so protected as copyright, are
sold in much larger numbers than similar works in
our own country, however cheap. How is this?
The American people are much more universally
readers than the English people. They are better
educated. They have a Government that considers
it a duty to educate the young without distinction,
and to afford the adult every means of intellectual
improvement. The American Government has
created a reading nation. Our Government has
created a people that rush to low casinos in the
towns, and to sottish beer-shops in the country.
The American Government accords all honour to
them who have laboured in the enlightenment of
the masses. Our Government wholly passes over
every such claim to recognition. It is of little consequence,
in the end, what Cabinets or Parliaments
do for the advance of education, or the encouragement
of men of letters. But it is somewhat unwise,
to say the least of it, to provoke, by neglect and by
injury, comparison with a nation that cultivates the
same language under different institutions, and
that can proclaim, in its energetic youth, that it has
raised up an intelligent people out of the great
mental inheritance to which our rulers have been
faithless.</p>

<p>By injury? it will be said. The British Government
may ignore letters, undervalue writers, barter
away its patronage upon ignorance and incapacity—but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">{274}</a></span>
assuredly it cannot attempt to inflict direct
injury upon literature and learning? And yet it
does all this. The sale of school-books in the
United States has reached an almost fabulous
extent. Families have been raised to affluence by
the enormous circulation of a Spelling-book or a
Dictionary. A successful Grammar is a fortune.
He who can produce sensible and amusing Reading-Lessons
is better paid than a Secretary of State.
Does the Government bestow any gratuities upon
such services? Certainly not. But it does not discourage
and annihilate them. It does not, as our
Government does, interfere with competition by
attempting to regulate prices. It does not do the silly
thing which M. Louis Blanc wished to do in France
for "the organization of literary labour." It has
established no manufactory of school-books, produced
cheaply, by the tax-payers helping the production.
It has no Board of Commissioners, as we have,
"to supply the National Schools in Ireland, <i>and
the public generally</i>, with works in harmony with
an improved system of education, cheap in price
and superior in execution."<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_33" id="Ref_33" href="#Foot_33">[33]</a></span>
We ask, what possible right has the State to produce such books, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">{275}</a></span>
sell them in the open literary markets of this
country, to the injury of all who produce similar
books by the fair workings of capital and labour?
School-books were formerly too dear; but as schools
multiplied, cheaper books than the old standard
works came into the market, and many took root
and flourished. Much of this property has been
destroyed by the Government operation; which is
not confined to 'Reading Lessons,' but embraces
'Biographical Sketches of Poets'—'Selections from
the Poets'—'Epitome of Geographical Knowledge'—'Grammar,'
'Arithmetic,' 'Geometry,' 'Mensuration,'
'Agriculture,' 'Maps.' The compilers of
these books and maps are salaried state-servants;
the books are printed at the lowest contract; the
usual trade allowances are withheld; profit does not
enter into price. A book of 17½ sheets demy, or
420 pages, bound in cloth, is sold for <i>sevenpence</i>,
as we learn from the Commissioners' Catalogue.
This is exactly the cost price for the paper, machine-work,
and binding, in the very cheapest market.
There is nothing for trade-management, and not
one fraction for copyright. Commercial competition
is impossible. We say, this is a fraudulent
cheapness. All cheapness in books is fraudulent
which sets aside a payment for literary labour.
This is the cheapness of piracies, whether here or in
the United States. It is a cheapness that, if carried
out, as it might be by a Government, would degrade
literature to the lowest condition, annihilating
all invention and improvement. Once concede
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">{276}</a></span>
the principle that the State has a right to
produce educational books, except for the supply
of schools paid by the State—and even then the
policy is very doubtful—and there is no individual
literary enterprise that may not be paralyzed and
destroyed by this new agency. In England, the
only commercial undertaking of the State is that
of the Post Office. It is conducted with a profit;
it is conducted with a precision and cheapness
which really leave few things to be amended.
There are especial reasons why the conveyance of
letters through the whole civilized world should be
the work of the State. No company, no individual,
could grapple with such a gigantic task. But is
there any other branch of commercial enterprise
which the State could undertake with the
slightest benefit—without most serious injury? If
the end sought is to employ labour to a profit,
individual enterprise will accomplish that end far
better than the State. If the object is to employ
labour that shall be unprofitable, who is to supply
the deficiency in the funds that have called into
activity the profitable labour? There would indeed
be the equality of employments, but it would be
the equality of universal poverty. The skilled and
the unskilled would be reduced to the same level.
There would be no prizes in the social wheel;—the
blanks would be something worse than the mere
absence of superfluities.</p>

These are the words of an official puff, in 16 pages, called 'An
Analysis of the Irish National School-books.' A more impudent document
was never put forth by the Curlls of a past or present age. The
manufacturers of the Irish Reading Lessons pirated a copyright belonging
to the writer of this volume (occupying 47 pages, in 10 of their
Lessons), 'The Mineral Kingdom,' which was written by Mr.
Leonard Horner. Their 'Analysis' says, that these "most interesting
facts and reasonings relating to Organised Remains are extracted from
the writings of Buckland and other celebrated Geologists."</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VI.</h3>

<p class="gist">Cheap Fiction—Penny Periodicals.</p>

<p class="nodent"><span class="smc">The</span>
Railway Libraries—by which generic term
we mean single volumes, printed in small type
on indifferent paper, and sold mostly at a shilling—are
almost wholly devoted to novels,
English or American. Whatever be the quality
of the fiction so published, we may ask, without
any general depreciation of such works, if the
popularity of this class of reading has not a
tendency to indispose for other reading, however
attractive be the mode in which information, historical,
critical, or scientific, be presented; and is it
not a necessary consequence that books of another
character than novels should be compelled to
address themselves to a smaller class of readers,
and must, therefore, of necessity be dearer? If
this be true of the railway books, it is equally true
of the weekly sheets. The demand for fiction
amongst the largest class of readers has forced upon
every weekly periodical the necessity for introducing
fiction in some form or other. The writers
of eminence cannot put forth their powers in this
direction without charging a higher price for their
numbers than those in which inferior writers are
employed at low salaries. The higher price necessarily
induces a smaller sale. The dealers in cheap
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">{278}</a></span>
periodicals say, "you have no chance for a sale
unless you give <i>as much paper</i> as the others give
for a penny!" In this respect, some of the more
extensively circulated of these sheets would appear
to defy all reasonable competition. They are sold
for 50<i>s.</i> per thousand; their paper and machine-work
cost, at the very least, 45<i>s.</i> Out of this 5<i>s.</i>
per thousand they have to pay their publishing
expenses, their writers, their woodcuts, their composition,
their stereotype casts. It is a neck-and-neck
race for a very doubtful "plate;" and what may appear
a slight addition to the weight of the "riders,"
in the shape of another halfpenny a pound upon
their paper, would "distance" the greater number
of them. When the popular estimate of a publication
is that of the square inches which it contains
of print, it requires no critical judgment to
be assured that the amount of genius or knowledge
engaged in its production is not very great. Hence,
for the most part, a deluge of stories, that, to mention
the least evil of them, abound with false
representations of manners, drivelling sentimentalities,
and impossible incidents. And yet they are
devoured with an earnestness that is almost incomprehensible.
The moralist may say—</p>

</div>

</div>
</div>

<p class="nodent">How is the weaning to be set about for this babyhood
of the popular intellect?</p>

<p>The insuperable obstacle to a successful competition
with the existing class of penny periodicals
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">{279}</a></span>
is their pre-eminence in <i>external</i> cheapness. They
were all founded upon the principle of attraction
by low price alone. They employed the meanest
"slaves of the lamp" in their production. Sheets
came out double the size of any other penny sheet,
badly printed on the thinnest paper, but nevertheless
they were the largest sheets; their roots were
thus planted in the popular earth. Some who
bought them turned away from their filth and their
folly; others welcomed these qualities. Gradually
the sense of the better class of artisans operated,
whilst they continued their offences, to reduce their
number of customers. They changed their style;
they became decent, but they remained stupid.
The weeds were kept down, though not rooted out,
in that garden: a few gaudy flowers were planted;
fruit there was little. They have maintained their
hold, by their external cheapness, against any
attempt to produce a higher literature, with better
paper and print. They have beaten almost every
competitor who has sought to address <i>the same
class</i> of buyers with something higher, intrinsically
as cheap, but not so cheap to the eye. The unequal
war is still being waged.</p>

<p>In June, 1846, the last number of 'The Penny
Magazine' was published. Mr. Knight, who had
been its editor from the commencement, in 1832,
thus writes in his concluding 'Address to the
Reader,' after stating that there then were published
14 three-halfpenny and penny miscellanies,
and 37 weekly sheets, forming separate books:—"It
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">{280}</a></span>
is from this competition that the 'Penny
Magazine' now withdraws itself. Its editor most
earnestly wishes success to those who are keeping
on their course with honesty and ability.... He
rejoices that there are many in the field, and some
who have come at the eleventh hour, who deserve
the wages of zealous and faithful labourers. But
there are others who are carrying out the principle
of cheap weekly sheets to the disgrace of the
system, and who appear to have got some considerable
hold upon the less informed of the working
people, and especially upon the young. There
are manufactories in London whence hundreds of
reams of vile paper and printing issue weekly;
where large bodies of children are employed to
arrange types, at the wages of shirt-makers, from
copy furnished by the most ignorant, at the wages
of scavengers. In truth, such writers, if they
deserve the name of writers, <i>are</i> scavengers. All
the garbage that belongs to the history of crime
and misery is raked together, to diffuse a moral
miasma through the land, in the shape of the most
vulgar and brutal fiction." This is a curious and
instructive record. 'The Penny Magazine,' popular
as it once was, to the extent of a sale of
200,000, could not contend with a cheapness that
was wholly regardless of quality; and it could not
hold its place amidst this dangerous excitement.
The editor had his hands fettered by the necessity
of keeping up the purely instructive character of
that journal. Without a large supply of fiction
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">{281}</a></span>
it necessarily ceased to be popular. A French
writer, who laments over the "immondices" of the
literature of Paris in 1840, calls for romances
"appropriés par une imagination souple et brillante
au goût des classes laborieuses;" and he suggests
the principle upon which such works should be
founded, viz. "L'étude des mœurs populaires,
entreprise par un esprit pénétrant, et dirigée vers
un but philosophique."<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_34" id="Ref_34" href="#Foot_34">[34]</a></span>
 The "immondices" have
for the most part vanished from our English penny
literature. The host of penny Newgate novels,
whether known as 'The Convict,' 'The Feast of
Blood,' 'The Murder at the Old Jewry,' 'Claude
Duval,' 'The Hangman's Daughter,' and so forth,
may continue to be sold; but, as far as we can trace,
there are no novelties in this once popular literature
of the gallows. Abominations, called 'Mysteries'
and 'Castles,' still lurk in dark corners; but the
bulk of single Penny Novels, and the novels which
"drag their slow length along" in penny journals,
are marvellously changed. The most prudish
regard to decency presides over every sentence
and syllable. William the Conqueror has lost
the brief ignoble title by which the old Saxons
designated their oppressor, through a special interdict
of the proprietor of one of these papers; and
a lady of doubtful character must be mentioned by
no more rugged name than that of a <i>belle amie</i>,
which may be understood or not. But the "études
des mœurs populaires," and the "but philosophique,"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">{282}</a></span>
have not yet entered into the minds
of the conductors of these elaborate works.
Their scenes are invariably laid in the lord's
palace or the right honourable's mansion; marriages
are made at St. George's, Hanover Square,
and the diamonds are bought at Storr and Mortimer's.
If a young lady, who has the slight misfortune
to be connected by the filial tie with a
convicted felon, has a quarrel with her juvenile
lover, she immediately rushes to the arms of an
ancient baronet, who conducts her the next morning
to the altar of his parish church. Boileau said
of Mademoiselle Scudery, that she would never
let her heroine get out of a house till she had
taken an inventory of all the furniture. So, for
the bewilderment of those who read these weekly
novels by the one glimmering candle upon the
deal table, their sick ladies recline in easy chairs,
"astral" lamps diffuse their rich glow upon crimson
curtains, and aromatic perfumes fill the air from
pastiles burning in miniature castles of gilded porcelain.
The style of these productions is magnificent:
with golden zones on the summits of the
mountains, and roseate tints edging the canopy of
heaven; plants drooping with voluptuous languor,
and shining insects skimming the air, as if borne
on the wings of ardent passion. In all this we are
speaking <i>au pied de la lettre</i>. Johnson described
three sorts of unnatural style—the bombastic, the
affected, and the weak. Most of these performances
unite the three qualities, and are equally satisfactory
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">{283}</a></span>
to the "love of imbecility," which Johnson
thought was to be found in many. We have only
seen one penny journal which places its incidents,
and somewhat adapts its language, in consonance
with the habits of the classes which these works
seek to interest. In 'The Leisure Hour,' issued
by the Religious Tract Society, we have an Australian
story, with 'Sydney by Gaslight.' We
are now amongst convicts, and hear drunken
shouts come out from miserable huts. The success
of this publication is considerable. Perhaps those
who really understand such matters may say of
the writer of these laudable attempts to imitate
the homely style, something akin to what the
great Pierce Egan said of a fashionable novelist
twenty years ago—"Ah! he's very clever, but
uncommon superficial in slang." Nevertheless,
it is satisfactory to find that a mean has been
sought, in the quarter where we might least
have expected it, between the representations
of humble and even of low life which are corrupting,
and those pretended pictures of society
which exhibit no life at all. In the number of
'The Leisure Hour' for February 16, 1854, there
is a clever woodcut of a night auction at Sydney,
which is as suggestive of a congregation of real
vulgar sellers and bidders, with the necessary
accompaniments of gin and tobacco, as might be
connected with any of the exciting scenes of 'Life
in London' at any period. The pictures of the
penny sheets which the masses now greedily buy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">{284}</a></span>
are quite genteel. This is something to reflect
upon. Some of the members of the Tract Society
may think that "Chaos is come again." We do
not. This sort of subject will be attractive to the
better portion of male readers amongst the artisans,
and especially amongst the very large number who
belong to "temperance societies;" but for the girls,
who devour the novels of the other penny journals,
certainly not. Those who have been watching the
workings of the penny literature are unanimous in
their conviction that very few men read these
mawkish and unnatural fictions. The readers for
the most part belong, in point of cultivation, to
the same class of females, who, half a century ago,
gave up their whole leisure—if they did not
neglect every domestic duty—for the ghosts and
the elopements of 'The Minerva Press.' The intelligence
of the readers is the same, however
widened the attraction.</p>

<p>But, with all their bad taste, there is partial
merit and manifest utility in some portions of the
best of these penny journals. 'The Family Herald'
has constantly a serious article of great good sense
and shrewdness. This paper, and one or two others,
have pages of "Answers to Correspondents," which,
for the most part, contain useful information and
judicious advice. Real young ladies often pour
their doubts into the ear of this "Family" oracle,
about love, and courtship, and marriage; and, as far
as we can judge, receive very safe counsel. In the
whole range of these things we can detect nothing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">{285}</a></span>
that bears a parallel with what used to be called
"the blasphemous and seditious press." Neither,
although these papers do not wholly abstain
from comment upon what is passing in the world,
can they be called newspapers. We see, however,
that the new trump of war is calling up again one
or two of the old class of unstamped violators of
the law. In quiet times they cannot flourish.

<p class="nodent"><span class="smc">Our</span>
readers can scarcely have failed to make for
themselves the deduction which naturally arises
out of this survey of the progress of popular literature—that
there always have been, still are, and
always will be, various classes of readers and purchasers;
and that the invariable progress of knowledge
and intelligence—from the learned to the rich,
from the rich to the middle classes, from the middle
classes to the multitude—has produced as invariably
a corresponding change in the number of
books published, their quality, and their price. As
the rich began to gather knowledge, books ceased
to be wholly adapted to the learned or professional
student; as the burgesses began to employ their
leisure in reading, books ceased to be dependent upon
courtly influence; as the multitude acquired the
rudiments of instruction, books became less conventional,
and began to adapt themselves to all
classes. But it cannot, without a judicial blindness,
be assumed that we are arrived at that state
in which there are no degrees of intellectual advancement.
It is said, to use the language of the
most popular journal of our day, that the masses
"do not yet feel the assurance that, if they go in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">{287}</a></span>
thousands to the counters of the great publishing
houses, as they congregate around the more plebeian
shops, they will get the exact article they want, or
what <i>they</i> consider value for their money." Here
is the point. The masses, who are yet more imperfectly
educated than some of their own class,
and most of the class above them, would not consider,
as they have never yet considered, solid and
instructive reading "value for their money." Unquestionably
"books to please the million must
not only be good but attractive." The chief popular
labour of the last quarter of a century has been
to convert the ponderous ores of learning into the
fine gold of knowledge. The multitude have been
reached in many directions; and the influences of
"good but attractive" books have penetrated
where the books themselves have not yet had a
direct influence. But the multitude stand precisely
in the same relation to works of instruction,
even the most attractive, as they do to Mechanics'
Institutes and Athenæums. In Manchester and
its dependencies, in 1851, there were 3447 members
of these Institutions, and 1793 pupils in classes.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_35" id="Ref_35" href="#Foot_35">[35]</a></span>
But the great mass of the youth of both
sexes in Manchester were frequenting the Casinos.
Here they neither drank, nor danced, nor gambled:
they listened to recitations and comic songs at a
penny an hour. They wanted mere amusement,
and they found it. It is the same with the great
bulk of the readers of cheap books. "It is most
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">{288}</a></span>
worthy of note," says the writer just mentioned,
whose anxiety for cheap literature we honour and
appreciate, "that, when there has been no doubt
of the substantial value of the commodity issued
from the Row or Albemarle Street, the sale of the
books has been by no means equivocal." Certainly
not. Macaulay and Layard have found large numbers
of purchasers, and will find them, in their
cheap form. But are these purchasers what are
called, in the same breath, "the multitude"—"the
needy"? Not at all. Even the most successful
of the periodical works above a penny—'Chambers'
Journal,' 'Household Words,'—reach only the advanced
guard of this class. Mr. Dickens collected
around him at Birmingham such an audience as
never before waited upon an author. He read his
beautiful, humanizing 'Christmas Carol' to two
thousand working-men. They felt every point—they
laughed, or they grew serious, with understanding.
But are we to suppose that the whole
mass of the mechanical classes—men, women, and
children—throughout the kingdom, would rush by
millions to buy 'The Christmas Carol' at a penny
or two—at a price that would compensate in fame
what was wanting in profit? Its sterling merit—its
nature, its simplicity, its purity, its quiet humour—require
a far higher amount of taste and cultivation
to appreciate than the immaturity of mind to
which the coarseness and imbecility of the penny
journals are acceptable. An author of less popular
acceptation published a poem at a farthing, but we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">{289}</a></span>
never heard that he employed a steam-press in its
production. The multitude have their own weekly
literature, and we have seen what it is. Are the
novels of the author of 'Pelham' to be speedily
found in every cottage of the farm-labourer, and
in every garret of the Lancashire cotton-spinner?
The time may come, but it is not as yet. If a
despotic government, in the desire to disseminate
knowledge, were to follow the example which our
free Government has set with regard to the 'School-books
published by authority of the Commissioners
of National Education in Ireland,' they might
produce sound popular literature as cheap again as
the most adventurous of publishers. But if they left
competition free to what they considered unsound
knowledge—if they permitted the lowest-priced
Fiction, however bad or indifferent, to circulate
without their unequal competition—we believe the
free-traders would beat the monopolists in point
of numbers; and it would be found an easier task,
even with every commercial disadvantage of price,
to "tickle and excite the palate" than "strengthen
the constitution."</p>

<p>Do such considerations as these make us hopeless
of the steady progress of a sound as well as
cheap popular literature? Decidedly no. There
is improvement all around us. The halfpenny
ballad of Seven Dials is not yet extinct; but let the
collectors look sharply about them, for that relic
of the chap-books, with the woodcuts that have
served every generation, will soon be gone. In its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">{290}</a></span>
place has come the decent penny book of a hundred
songs. The shades of Scott, and Moore, and
Campbell will not quarrel with this new popularity.
There are "flash" songs; but they are not for the
penny buyers. Thackeray has described the dens
in which these abominations are current. The
whole aspect of the humbler press has changed
within these few years. Unquestionably the people
have changed. Visit, if you can, the interior of
that marvellous human machine, the General Post-Office,
on a Friday evening, from half-past five to
six o'clock. Look with awe upon the tons of newspapers
that are crowding in to be distributed
through the habitable globe. Think silently how
potent a power is this for good or for evil. You
turn to one of the boxes of the letter-sorters, and
your guide will tell you, "this work occupies not
half the time it formerly did, for everybody writes
better." General education furnishes the solution
of the otherwise doubtful origin of the improvement,
in all the more manifest characteristics of
improvement, of all popular literature.</p>

<p>In 1801 the annual circulation of newspapers in
England and Wales was 15 millions, and in Scotland
1 million. In 1853 the annual circulation of England
and Wales was 72 millions, and of Scotland 8
millions, that of Ireland being also about 8 millions.
In September, 1836, the stamp-duty on newspapers
was reduced to one penny. Immediately previous
to the reduction the annual circulation of newspapers
in Great Britain was about 29 millions.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">{291}</a></span>
The increase, therefore, in seventeen years, has
been 51 millions. We have cast up the twenty-two
folio pages of the 'Return of the number of
Newspaper Stamps, at one penny, issued in 1853,'
and we find these results, as derived from the
stamps, excluding supplements, used by 913 newspapers
in England, 18 in Wales, 146 in Scotland,
and 121 in Ireland, making a total number of
1198. But it must be borne in mind that about
one-half of the publications in this return, called
newspapers, are not newspapers in any sense of the
word. Every publication can be stamped as a
newspaper, for which the proprietor and printer
give the necessary legal securities; and thus hundreds
of price-currents, catalogues, and circulars—and
many literary journals which are only partially
stamped, and which none but political pedants,
calling for a definition, term newspapers—find
their way into this Official Return. There are, in
round numbers, 600 newspapers proper in the
United Kingdom. There are in London 14 daily
papers, 6 twice and thrice a week, and 71 weekly;
and about 500 provincial papers in the United
Kingdom. Of the London Daily Papers, about
24 millions are annually circulated, of which the
'Times' has the lion's share of 14 millions. There
are four weekly papers, published at the surpassingly
cheap rate of threepence, which circulate 13 millions.
The 'Illustrated London News' has a circulation
of 4 millions; and eleven other leading
weekly papers issue, annually, 6 millions. There
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">{292}</a></span>
are 6 religious papers, which have a circulation of
about a million and a quarter. Thus, 36 London
publications engross 48 million stamps, out of 71
millions. Of the Provincial English Press there
are 26 great towns which number 80 papers, and
these 80 consume 13 millions of stamps. We
have, therefore, only 10 millions more to distribute
amongst the entire newspaper press of England.
The Welsh annual circulation is under a
million.</p>

<p>We have abstracted from the Official Return the
number of stamps used annually by papers published
in great cities and towns, especially the
large marts of commerce and manufactures:—</p>

<p>The altered tone and ability of newspapers would
open too wide a subject to be here dwelt upon in
detail. One of the weekly threepenny papers has
attained an enormous sale—a sale of 4½ millions
annually—by discarding what was offensive to
public morals, under the management of a man of
letters who has a reputation to maintain. The
Satirists and Paul Prys are gone. The extension
of the mental labourers for newspapers, in proportion
to the extension of the demand, has
followed the same course as that of every other
production of the press, from the days of the first
printers. At the beginning of the present century
the local newspapers "had no editorial comments whatever,"<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_36" id="Ref_36" href="#Foot_36">[36]</a></span>
and scarcely an original paragraph.
The conductors of our 500 provincial journals are
now watching for every particle of news in their
own districts; reporting public meetings; waiting
for electric telegraphs; pondering upon grave questions
of social economy; and, to the best of their
judgment, fairly representing the course of events.
How much of this intelligent and honourable spirit
they owe to the London Newspaper Press is not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">{294}</a></span>
for us to decide. We believe the newspaper influence
upon the people to be for good, because the
Newspaper Press is National. A witness, giving
evidence before the Select Committee on Newspaper
Stamps, 1851, said, "If the Committee were
to look at 'The Weekly Dispatch' twenty years
ago, its general character was very much worse
than it is now. Then it was a so-called radical,
almost a blasphemous, scurrilous, and contemptible
paper, but with an enormous circulation. Now
other papers have so much improved, that 'The
Weekly Dispatch' has been compelled, in its own
defence, very materially to change its tone." But
what improved the "other papers," and compelled
them to seek honest means of "an enormous
circulation"? We answer—The advanced intelligence
of the people. Books had begun their own
work in the career of public enlightenment. Now,
newspapers and books are working together for the
same object. It is desired by some to make newspapers
supersede books, by abolishing the stamp,
and thus converting all popular literature into
news. We have no faith in the process. An
American told the Committee on Stamps that "the
only knowledge which the working-classes would
appreciate is contained in newspapers; they address
themselves much more to politics than to science or
literature." The witness had his own country in his
mind, where the assertion is to some extent true.
But in the American newspapers, almost universally,
there is something more than "politics." All over
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">{295}</a></span>
the Union the newspapers are filled, week by week,
by the piracy of modern English literature, especially
of English fiction. Whether the "working
classes" read the politics, and neglect the literature,
maybe doubted. If politics are independent
of science and literature, the study is worth little.
It is degrading. We doubt if this disposition,
carried to excess, will make a wise people, or a
happy people. The opinion of an American is
worth little upon such a question in England.
There is no parallel in the condition of the people
of the United States. The geographical position,
and the separate constitutions of individual states,
necessarily demand many newspapers. Thus the
newspapers of the United States, even with their
large circulation, are essentially local. The English
papers, we repeat, are national. The papers of
the capital are the papers of the empire. They
chiefly, with their wonderful organization, supply
the material for the twenty-seven millions of these
islands, and the other millions of our race spread
over the habitable globe in our colonies, to learn, to
consider, to know their rights, to perform their
duties. Could this unequalled instrument of
knowledge be kept efficiently at work, while
every petty printer of every parish was ready to
make a venture for a thousand penny subscribers
to his Argus or his Luminary, without incurring
any of the prodigious cost of a London daily
morning paper? If the time should come when
the land should be filled with penny newspapers,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">{296}</a></span>
it would be the same with newspapers as it is now
with the weekly unstamped sheets. Quantity, not
quality, would be the criterion of excellence. The
lower grade of literary labourers would be multiplied
tenfold. Unscrupulous employers would rise
up on every side, who would go for the "immondices"
if decency failed; and for disorder if tranquillity
were growing unprofitable. The rich would
be set against the poor, and the poor against the
rich. Those who now organise strikes by their
eloquence would work more effectually with their
pen; and employers would not be without their
organs to defend harshness and oppression. Sects
would denounce each other in weekly journals, to
be sold by the pew-opener; and the Snoreum
Vestry would enter upon a wordy war with their
neighbours of Muggleton. Let us "study to be
quiet."</p>

<p>It is proposed to establish penny newspapers for
the especial benefit of the agricultural labourers.
How are they to be circulated? If postage is to be
paid in addition to the price, there is little gained
over the present system; for there are published,
weekly, about 300,000 newspapers at 3<i>d.</i> If they
do not go by post, how are they to reach the scattered
hamlets? This is really the difficulty, with
regard to all periodical literature, in raising up
agricultural labourers into a population of readers.
It is satisfactory to know that the keys to knowledge—the
power of reading and writing—are
being as freely imparted to the rural population as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">{297}</a></span>
to those of towns. There is progress. In 1841 the
proportion, to all marriages, of those who signed
the marriage-register with marks, was—men, 33
per cent.; women, 49 per cent. In 1853 the proportion
was—men, 30 per cent.; women, 45 per
cent. In 1863 the effect of the education of the
last ten years will be tested upon the same principle.
But it is to be noted, in the Registrar-General's
Returns for 1853, that in the Agricultural
South-Eastern Division, as well as in other agricultural
districts, there was slight difference in the
proportion between males and females; while in
the North-Western Manufacturing Division the
number of females who could not write was nearly
double that of the males. In the South-Eastern
Division, comprising the rural parts of Surrey and
Kent, Sussex, Hampshire, and Berkshire, in the
cases of 11,537 marriages, 3457 men and 3749
women signed with marks. In the North-Western
Division, comprising Cheshire and Lancashire, in
the cases of 24,877 marriages, 8729 men and
15,443 women signed with marks. There cannot
be a greater proof of the influence of a resident
clergy, looking diligently to National Schools, and
perhaps stimulated by the zeal of dissent in the
same useful direction, than this fact. It makes us
hopeful of the eventual advance of the rural population
to the condition of a reading people. But
the question always arises—What are they to read?
What will they read? Is the edge of the cup not
only to be honeyed, but is the whole cup to be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">{298}</a></span>
filled with sweets? How are we to find the mean
between what is dry and what is useless—what is
plain and what is childish? A witness of well-known
intelligence told the Committee on Newspaper
Stamps that in his village he tried the
experiment of reading 'The Times' to an evening-class
of adult labourers, and that he could not
read twenty lines without feeling that there were
twenty words in it which none of his auditors
understood. He wanted, therefore, cheap newspapers,
that would be so written as not to puzzle
the hearers or readers by such words as "operations,"
"channel," or " fleet." For ourselves, we
would rather endure as much book ignorance as
we endured in the first quarter of this century,
than believe that knowledge might be promoted
by writing down to the intelligence of the least
instructed class; and that they could be raised up
into enlightenment upon this plan of Mr. Hickson,
to have newspapers that would reach their minds
like "school-primers, containing words of one or
two syllables." Such partial enlightenment would
be general degradation.</p>

<p>Upon looking around upon all the various phases
of Cheap Literature which now present themselves
in these kingdoms, we cannot shut our eyes to the
fact that, in proportion as the number of readers
has increased, the desire of the mass of the population
has been rather for passing amusement than
solid instruction. There is one very obvious reason
for this. The people of this country work harder
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">{299}</a></span>
than any other people, not only from the absolute
necessity of the competition around them, but
through the energy of their race. It cannot, therefore,
in the nature of things, be expected that
much of the reading of all classes should be other
than for amusement. Further, when we consider
how recent has been the training for any reading
amongst a large proportion of those who have
become readers, we can scarcely look for a great
amount of serious application in their short leisure
after a hard working-day. The entertainment
which is now presented to all, whether it be in the
shape of a shilling novel or a penny journal, is not
debasing; it may enfeeble the intellect, but it does
not taint it. How are we to deal with this
universal desire for amusement? Not, we think,
by any direct efforts at its counteraction, either by
individuals or societies. We have before us three
volumes, just completed, of a most excellent penny
weekly publication of 'The Society for Promoting
Christian Knowledge,' entitled 'The Home Friend.'
It is cheap, even by comparison with the cheapest
of the class. It consists of twenty-four octavo
pages, and is excellently printed on superior paper.
The old patronising style of such works is given
up. It deals with grave subjects in an agreeable
spirit. In the preface to the first volume, the
editor rejoices that the Society is enabled to
publish a work attainable by "the tenant of the
lowliest cottage, which a century ago could only
be purchased by the opulent few." But it is not a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">{300}</a></span>
matter of congratulation that this work, like others
professing the same aims, has not had any great
success, from the absolute want of buyers. It was
thought that the members of the Society could have
commanded a great weekly circulation amongst their
neighbours. The average sale never went beyond
12,000. What, then, is to be the course of the
real friends of popular instruction? We think it
is, to let the existing cheap literature purify itself.
We have got beyond the scurrilous stage—the
indecent stage—the profane stage—the seditious
stage. Let us hope that the frivolous stage, in
which we are now to some extent abiding, will in
time pass on to a higher taste, and a sounder
mental discipline. "Confidence," said Chatham,
"is a plant of slow growth." So is taste; so is a
love of knowledge for its own sake. Let us make
real instruction as attractive as we can; but let us
have no compromises under the pretence of gilding
the pill. Study is study, and amusement is amusement.
Let the people learn, and learn they will,
in time; but let us abandon all the old, childish
attempts of cheating them into learning. The
circle of those who are attaining sound knowledge
is steadily widening. Already, as the circle has
widened, the means of acquiring information have
been offered to "the masses," and even to "the
needy," at a rate of cheapness quite unequalled by
any previous attempts to make sound knowledge
popular. We now especially allude to 'The Penny
Cyclopædia'—a work of which the literature and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">{301}</a></span>
engravings alone cost the publisher, as he has
recorded, the large sum of 42,000<i>l.</i> Those who
affect to believe that nothing has been done for
the cheapening of books, should recollect that,
before the existence of this Cyclopædia, no great
work of reference of this nature could be obtained
under 40<i>l.</i> But 'The Penny Cyclopædia,' large
as was its sale, was not profitable; it involved
an enormous loss. The writer, in his 'Struggles
of a Book,' has stated that the paper-duty
operated as a burthen upon 'The Penny Cyclopædia'
to the extent of 32,000<i>l.</i> He adds,—"Had
that sum of 32,000<i>l.</i> been actually saved to
me, I should not have been a pound richer by the
publication of 'The Penny Cyclopædia.' But
with the saving I should not have been to that
amount poorer." Compared with the vast outlay,
'The Penny Cyclopædia' was set at too low a
price for the probable demand. The class of buyers
for instruction was not large enough to carry off
40,000  copies, which would have yielded adequate
profit. The very word "Penny" was then repulsive,
and implied something low, as apprehended
by the rich vulgar. Moreover, the book occupied
eleven years in its issue, and its sale fell from
50,000  at the beginning to less than 20,000 in
the end. No work that occupied more than four
or five years in its completion was ever successful
in this country. In the publication of 'The
English Cyclopædia,' which is founded upon 'The
Penny Cyclopædia,' a more prudent course has
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">{302}</a></span>
been adopted. The new book is issued in four
divisions, which will form four separate Cyclopædias
of Geography, Natural History, Sciences,
and Biography, each of which will be completed in
little more than two years from its commencement.
Comparing the two books—'The Penny' and
'The English'—we can readily see the vast
augmentations of knowledge during twenty years
that render the complete re-modelling of such a
work absolutely necessary. In every branch of
exact knowledge this re-modelling has become
indispensable; and upon other works of instruction
many earnest labourers are so engaged. Publishers
cannot now afford to let their books, especially
their educational books, remain without improvement.
It is thus that, in spite of the tendency to
light reading, the supply of real knowledge is kept
up. Those who find an ally of knowledge in the
purer and more ennobling fiction, such as our
literature, past and present, abundantly supplies,
are gradually brought into the extending circle of
earnest readers. The great region beyond is still
little cultivated; but even there the subsoil-plough
has been at work, and there is some grain amidst
the weeds. The weeds cannot be rooted out by

<h3>CHAPTER VIII.</h3>

<p class="gist">Free Libraries—In Towns—In Rural Districts—Influences of the
best Books.</p>

<p class="nodent"><span class="smc">It</span>
is difficult to point out a direct practical remedy
for much that is injurious in our cheapest
popular literature; and especially any remedy that
could be supplied by the State. We cannot cure
folly by enactments, however we may try to repress
crime. "These things will be, and must be; but
how they shall be least hurtful, how least enticing,
herein consists the grave and governing wisdom of
a State. To sequester out of the world into Atlantic
and Utopian policies, which never can be drawn
into use, will not mend our condition, but to ordain
wisely as in this world of evil, in the midst whereof
God hath placed us unavoidably."</p>

<p>This noble sentence, from Milton's 'Speech for
the Liberty of Unlicensed Printing,' suggests some
remarks which, however painful to utter, no one
who thinks honestly upon the subject of popular
enlightenment can disguise. There is <span class="smc lc">NO</span> "grave
and governing wisdom" in the English State—there
is <span class="smc lc">NO</span> desire "to ordain wisely"—in any
matter connected with the educational advancement
of the people. The greatest discouragement in the
first stage,—the most niggardly support in the
second,—have been given to the education of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">{304}</a></span>
young. With the exception of Schools of Design,
which, however useful, have a very limited object,
the education of the adult has been retarded by
every possible legislative effort, direct or indirect.
In 1849 a Select Committee of the House of Commons,
to inquire into "the best means of extending
the establishment of libraries, freely open to the
public, especially in large towns, in Great Britain
and Ireland," came to the unanimous resolution
that "our present inferior position is unworthy of
the power, the liberality, and the literature of the
country." An Act had been passed in 1845, by
which Town Councils, in Municipal Boroughs having
10,000 inhabitants and upwards, in England
and Wales, were empowered to establish <i>Museums</i>
at their own discretion. In 1850, seconding the
Report of the Committee of 1849, a Bill was
brought in "for enabling Town Councils to establish
<i>Public Libraries</i> and Museums," in towns
of the like large population. The proposal was
damaged by the device of requiring that a poll of
the burgesses should first have been duly taken on
the question, and that a rate of one halfpenny in
the pound should be the maximum to be levied by
a majority of votes. The consequence was obvious.
Those of the rate-payers who had the low shopkeeping
jealousy of extending knowledge to those
they presumed to call beneath them, rejected the
proposition for establishing Free Libraries at Birmingham
and at Exeter. In the mean time the difficulties
have been surmounted in four great Lancashire
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">{305}</a></span>
towns, Manchester, Liverpool, Salford, Bolton,
where 50,000<i>l.</i> have been raised, chiefly by voluntary
subscription, for Free Libraries and Museums;
and 60,000 volumes have been purchased for the
open and unrestricted use, in the libraries and at
home, of every member of the community, from the
highest to the humblest. The experiment has been
completely successful. One of the most satisfactory
results has been that, amidst the hardest worked
population in the world—those who come from
their factories with the honourable stain of labour
on their hands and brows—the most exemplary
care has been taken of the books borrowed. If
Free Libraries are good for the greatest marts of
industry, are they not good for the smaller? Mr.
Ewart, the unwearied mover in this object, brings
in a Bill in the Session of 1854, to extend the Act
of 1850 to towns of less population and to the
metropolitan boroughs; and, further, to remedy a
great defect in the former Bill, that the money
raised by the halfpenny rate might be applied to
purchase books as well as to provide buildings. On
the 5th of April the House of Commons throws out
this Bill, under the most frivolous pretexts; the
real object being to truckle to the prejudices of
those who in all times have systematically opposed
the progress of knowledge, when there is a chance
of extending it to <i>the people</i> universally.</p>

<p>It is in connexion with all we have said in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">{306}</a></span>
preceding pages, about the character and tendency
of cheap popular literature, that we have looked
forward with hope to the general establishment of
Free Libraries in town and country. Mechanics'
Institutes, and Literary and Scientific Institutions,
valuable as they have been, do not embrace the
class for which they were originally intended.
According to returns prepared by Dr. Hudson,
Secretary of the Manchester Athenæum, in 1851,
there were 720 such institutions, with 120,000
members, and they possessed 815,000 volumes of
books. But the same zealous person honestly tells
us that the majority of Literary Institutions comprise
professional men, the higher shopkeepers,
and the managers of large firms; that the clerk
and the shopman will not go where they have a
chance of being looked coldly on by their employers
or superiors in service, and resort to Mechanics'
Institutes, where their presence effectually drives
out the fustian jackets. To remedy this was one
of the especial objects of Free Libraries, where
books should be liberally provided for <i>all</i>, whether
for reference or home reading. A large majority
of the borrowers of books from the Manchester
Free Library belong to the operative class. Is it
not of some importance that the warehousemen,
packers, artisans, machinists, mill-hands male and
female, assistants in shops male and female, dressmakers,—should
have access to the standard works
of English literature, and the current books of the
modern press? Is there no great beneficial effect
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">{307}</a></span>
to be produced by the 77,232 volumes that in the
first year were issued from the same Manchester
Free Library, comprising—in theology, 1130; philosophy,
845; history, 22,837; law, politics, and
commerce, 839; sciences and arts, 4319; and
general literature, including poetry, fiction, essays,
and periodicals, 47,262? Is it of no importance
that, in the same period, 61,080 volumes have
been used in the reference department? How
long are those who are apt to think that</p>

<p class="center small">"The wealthiest man among us is the best,"</p>

<p class="nodent">to influence the better thoughts, and control the
higher impulses, of those who have no vain fears
that knowledge, however widely extended, may
produce evil to society? The object of the general
diffusion of knowledge is not to render men discontented
with their lot—to make the peasant
yearn to become an artisan, or the artisan dream
of the honours and riches of a profession—but to
give the means of content to those who, for the
most part, must necessarily remain in that station
which requires great self-denial and great endurance;
but which is capable of becoming not only
a condition of comfort, but of enjoyment, through
the exercise of these very virtues, in connexion
with a desire for that improvement of the understanding
which, to a large extent, is independent
of rank and riches. It is a most fortunate circumstance,
and one which seems especially ordained
by Him who wills the happiness of his creatures,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">{308}</a></span>
that the highest, and the purest, and the most
lasting sources of enjoyment are the most accessible
to all. The great distinction that has hitherto prevailed
in the world is this,—that those who have
the command of riches and of leisure have alone
been able, in any considerable degree, to cultivate
the tastes that open these common sources of enjoyment.
The first desire of every man is, no doubt,
to secure a sufficiency for the supply of the physical
necessities of our nature; but in the equal dispensations
of Providence it is not any especial portion
of the condition even of the humblest among us
who labours with his hands to earn his daily bread,
that his mind should be shut out from the gratifications
which belong to the exercise of our observing
and reflecting faculties. View the agricultural labourer
as we have been too long accustomed to see
him—a rude untutored hind. His most ordinary
occupations place him amongst scenes highly favourable
to the cultivation of some of the purest
and most peaceful thoughts. The general introduction
of agricultural machinery and agricultural
chemistry has an inevitable tendency to demand
a race of skilled labourers, instead of unintellectual
serfs. But how do we deal with the labourer and
his family? We educate the boys and girls up to
a certain point; we give them the rudiments of
knowledge; we are now asked to go further, and
to teach them "common things," by which we understand,
chiefly, the practical applications of
science. But, once off the school-form, the rural
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">{309}</a></span>
boy is to find his evening amusement in the beershop,
and the girl to make her way to the next
town, in search of some gaiety that ends fatally.
Home has no charms for these. Books might be
some attraction, but how are they to be got?
There are books which well-meaning people will
lend—but they are for the most part of an exclusively
serious character. None of the fair features
of knowledge are presented to them; no "perpetual
feast of nectared sweets." They are offered the Sunday
sermon without the Sunday holiday. It is
clear that this system will not do; and the most
sensible in the country have abandoned it. We
have before us a catalogue of the 'Windsor Park
Library, under the patronage of His Royal Highness
the Ranger.' This Park Library, established
by Prince Albert, is for the use of all those in the
local employ of the Crown. These comprise a
population of about 300, of which 100 are subscribers
to this library, at sixpence a quarter. It
is self-governed, with the assistance of the curate of
the Park, who has the right of approval of the books
given or purchased. Here is an agricultural population
of a mixed character—keepers, bailiffs, woodmen,
ploughmen, and field and forest lads. This
hard-working and comfortable population is not
crammed with "harsh and crabbed" knowledge.
There are good books in the library—divinity, history,
biography, natural history—but there is abundance
of poetry and fiction. The result is that the
library is most popular; that it has a visible influence
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">{310}</a></span>
on the families of the subscribers; that the population
thus intellectually raised, in the power of
happily employing their small leisure, are a consented
home-keeping population. There are, no
doubt, peculiar advantages in their position; but
the intelligence which is thus cultivated amongst
their dependants by the highest in the land would
ultimately raise every rural population, if the obvious
means were not too commonly neglected.</p>

<p>We have spoken strongly about the indifference
of the State to the establishment of Free
Libraries in populous towns. But even those
who have most strenuously urged this measure
have said nothing about such institutions in rural
districts. We ask, why not?  The necessity is as
great, perhaps greater. A ready access to instructive
books, and amusing books, is the desire which
most naturally suggests itself to the young people
who have left the schools which the State recognizes,
however imperfectly. The desire cannot be
gratified except through some occasional benevolence.
Thus the neglected mind first grows listless—then
corrupt. Dangerous excitement begins
the career which ends in habitual degradation.
There could be nothing easier that to make the
National School a Free Library also. The room
is vacant after the hours of work; the schoolmaster
is the ready librarian. It would be the truest
economy in parishes to provide such Free Libraries
out of the ordinary rates, if Parliament were to
give them an enabling power. Gratuitous vaccination,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">{311}</a></span>
preventive measures against contagion,
are cheerfully paid for. Why not a payment of
the most limited amount—a farthing on each
pound of rental—to keep the people sober, to
render them domestic, to raise them gradually but
surely to the capacity of discharging those labours
with skill which have been formerly intrusted to
mere animal power? It would be well, we think,
to make the experiment.</p>

<p>In thus advocating the general establishment of
Free Libraries, we believe that we are pointing out
the only practicable course for counteracting the
tendencies of <i>cheap periodical literature</i>. The
principle which is now carried, as we have endeavoured
to show, to a dangerous and ridiculous excess,
is to give the greatest possible quantity at
the lowest possible price. The principle is destructive
to the employment of the highest class
of literary labour. It involves the natural mediocrity
or positive baseness of that quality which is
not visible on the surface. The counteracting
principle is to make the best <i>books</i> accessible to
all; and not to imagine that the evil is not counteracted
if those who have access to the best books
prefer the entertaining to the severe. One of the
most eminent cultivators of the highest knowledge,
Sir John Herschel, has told us a great truth in
this matter, which ought never to be forgotten.
Defending what he calls "the invaluable habit of
resorting to books for pleasure," as the main desire of
those who "have grown up in a want of instruction,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">{312}</a></span>
and in a carelessness of their own improvement,"
he says—"If we would generate a taste for
reading, we must, as our only chance of success,
begin by pleasing.... In the <i>higher and
better class</i> of works of fiction and imagination,
duly circulated, you possess all you require to strike
your grappling-iron into their souls, and chain
them, willing followers, to the car of advancing
civilization."</p>

<p>We have said that cheap literature has got
beyond its scurrilous, indecent, profane, and seditious
stages. Six years ago it exhibited every one
of these qualities. We think it will not return to
them. But there is an element of danger which, if
not so revolting, is far more formidable. It is that
element which has for its materials the disputes between
labour and capital. There is ignorance on
both sides of this question. There is indifference
on the part of the State. A period of great and
increasing commercial prosperity has softened
down many of the coarser and fiercer aspects of
these disputes; but in no case have they been reduced
to an intelligible philosophy on the part of
employers or of workmen. Let the prosperity of
trade be interrupted by war; let our markets be
narrowed; let profits necessarily fall, and wages
with them; and what lessons, we may ask, have
been acquired of mutual dependence and mutual
interests, of conciliation and of brotherhood, in the
season which was favourable to instruction? Political
economy has been too long taught in a onesided
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">{313}</a></span>
spirit; but, nevertheless, its great truths
remain unaltered. Are the people unwilling to
search them out? Practically, are they reluctant
to apply them? They know, right well, that profits
and wages are distinct matters; that one belongs
to capital and the other to labour; that if they are
to have both they must become capitalists. They
try, upon the smallest, and therefore the most
hazardous scale, to unite labour and capital by cooperation.
They cannot try the principle upon a
larger scale, through the evil agency of our laws of
partnership. The Legislature inquires into the
matter, and there leaves it. The Legislature complains
that strikes are ruinous to all concerned, and
does nothing to bring about that union—a union
of feelings as well as interests—which would destroy
strikes. The Legislature says that the people
have no economical or historical knowledge, and
forbids Free Libraries. Sixty years ago, Burke
calculated that there were eighty thousand <i>readers</i>
in this country. If Burke had lived in times when
there are fourteen hundred thousand buyers of
cheap weekly sheets, whose readers probably
amount to five millions, would his great philosophical
mind have said, as modern legislation says,
Do whatever you can to prevent this reading going
in a right direction; you cannot stop reading, but
you can keep the cheap literature debased, by
denying the people access to the great original
thinkers who would lift them out of their intellectual
twilight into a brighter day? Would Edmund
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">{314}</a></span>
Burke have given such counsel? Would he have
shrunk from admitting the people to the safe and
enduring equality of a participation in the common
property of mind? He would have said, as he said
in 1770—"All the solemn plausibilities of the
world have lost their reverence and effect." He
would now have added—Build your future authority
and your respect, not upon ignorance, but
upon knowledge.</p>

<p>For the proper supply of such Free Libraries,
we have a new class of Books rising fast into importance—Books
of established value, carefully
edited—the Poets, the Historians, the Critical and
Philosophical Writers. The great Divines will not
be neglected in this good work. There cannot
be cheaper books of this class than Mr. Murray's
'British Classics,' than Mr. Bohn's various series,
than several Collections of the Poets now in course
of publication. We rejoice to see <i>well-printed</i>
books for the Library appear at half the old prices;
and to know that there is some chance of the eyes
of a generation not prematurely perishing under
the inflictions of a typography inferior to the ordinary
newspaper. Free Libraries would create a
large and certain demand for such works. With
the majority, the fame of our great writers is little
more than the scrolls upon their tombs. Let our
glorious Literature no longer be, for the People,</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
